       "    'abstract': 'Evaluating Information Retrieval (IR) systems is essential yet challenging. The dynamic nature of information and relevance further complicates IR. For example, Adar et al. observed that as early as 2009, websites frequently changed multiple times per hour. In response, recent IR systems have become more personalized, semantic, and context-aware. They evolved from lexical ranking functions to complex neural models embedded in feature-rich systems. While this often improves retrieval quality, it also challenges their reliability and robustness. The proposed research is motivated by the overarching goal of maintaining the trustworthiness of IR systems. To do so a rigorous evaluation is needed. Only by assessing the quality of a system can it be maintained and improved. Such an evaluation can not take place in isolation but must consider the dynamics of the search setting at all stages of a system—from development to maintenance and improvement. Based on the CRISP-DM methodology, these stages are sketched out as an ``IR Life Cycle``, which we will further define and oppose with a continuous evaluation framework in future work. In this regard, the changing search setting and the alignment between evaluation methods are key problems to be investigated. The dynamic nature of the search setting makes it difficult to compare evaluation outcomes from different points in time. As systems and testbeds evolve, a common ground for comparison becomes elusive. Furthermore, when evaluations are conducted under dynamic conditions, their temporal validity becomes limited once the testbeds no longer match the current search setting. This calls into question how temporally robust evaluations are. Therefore, we aim to systematically reintroduce changes into evaluations and to identify synergies among evaluation methods. This will be addressed along the following research areas: Classifying changes: Initially, a formal definition of the search setting and its dynamics is created. Accordingly, we will examine how search settings and systems evolve. To track the effectiveness over time, especially the relation between observable queries and latent information needs, need to be investigated.  Comparing results: The changing setting makes a direct comparison of retrieval results difficult. To retain expressible and interpretable results and attribute the measured effects, we explored comparison strategies as a reproducibility problem.     Repeating evaluations: When the search setting deviates from the testbed, its validity becomes uncertain, and systems need to be re-evaluated. By estimating this uncertainty, it should be assessed if it is worth to update the testbed and re-evaluate the system.  Aligning evaluation methods: To improve the feasibility of repeated evaluations, we aim to align evaluation methods to identify alternatives for demanding components and to uncover synergies between complementary components. In summary, it is intended to scrutinize the abstractions made by conventional IR evaluations and assess systems from multiple perspectives to gain a more holistic understanding of IR systems.',\n",

Within this context, SaaT has been found to be a competitive alternative to the more studied Document-at-a-Time (DaaT) approach.Even so, JASSv2 [2, 6] and IOQP [4] remain the only well-known open-source SaaT search engines.We believe that a thorough study into their operation and components may provide valuable insights. We wish to use this knowledge to build a better baseline system for SaaT retrieval. Once established, we aim to improve upon it. Specifically, we ask: (1) Can we build a better baseline for Score-at-a-Time retrieval by finding the most efficient and effective components from existing systems?(2) Can we improve upon the baseline by updating QMX to make use of more recent SIMD technologies?(3) Can we improve upon the baseline with a new accumulator management strategy?(4) Can we improve upon the baseline with a new approach to early termination/pruning?It is not obvious what the current baseline for SaaT should be, or what components are the most efficient. Through investigating various aspects of the search engines — specifically integer compression, accumulator management, and early termination (ρ) -- we will build a more indicative baseline system. We highlight these components in particular as we have reason to believe they will be influential.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Sequential recommender systems often struggle with accurate personalized recommendations due to data sparsity issues. Existing works use variational autoencoders and generative adversarial network methods to enrich sparse data. However, they often overlook diversity in the latent data distribution, hindering the model’s generative capacity. This characteristic of generative methods can introduce additional noise in many cases. Moreover, retaining personalized user preferences through the generation process remains a challenge. This work introduces DGFedRS, a Federated Recommender System Based on Diffusion Augmentation and Guided Denoising, designed to capture the diversity in the latent data distribution while preserving user-specific information and suppressing noise. In particular, we pre-train the diffusion model using the recommender dataset and use a diffusion augmentation strategy to generate interaction sequences, expanding the sparse user-item interactions in the discrete space. To preserve user-specific preferences in the generated interactions, we employ a guided denoising strategy to guide the generation process during reverse diffusion. Subsequently, we design a noise control strategy to reduce the damage to personalized information during the diffusion process. Additionally, a stepwise scheduling strategy is devised to input generated data into the sequential recommender model based on their challenge levels. The success of the DGFedRS approach is demonstrated by thorough experiments conduct on three real-world datasets.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Generative AI (GenAI) models are increasingly employed for professional search tasks, from enterprise copilots to systematic reviews. Recently introduced \"deep research\" products (OpenAI, Google), marketed as automated professional search agents, promise comprehensive query generation and synthesis from large document sets. However, this drive toward automation risks minimizing user involvement, potentially leading to misaligned results and inappropriate reliance on AI-generated outputs \\\\cite{spatharioti2025effects}. Professional search, especially in domains such as biomedical research and systematic reviews, necessitates expert input, transparency, and user control, requirements often not met by current generative search tools. Interactive Information Retrieval (IIR) literature has long emphasized the value of user interactions and iterative search refinement \\\\cite{kelly2009methods}. The rise of generative search introduces innovative methods of accessing information through natural language interactions, which show promise in addressing complex information needs \\\\cite{suri2024usegenerativesearchengines}. However, professional search tasks differ substantially from general consumer searches, involving transparent criteria for relevance judgments and systematic data extraction processes \\\\cite{verbeneprofsearch}. Despite early evidence suggesting increased productivity among knowledge workers using GenAI tools \\\\cite{cambon2023early}, these systems also exhibit substantial shortcomings. Studies highlight issues such as unsupported claims, inaccurate citations, and overreliance on generated content, questioning the reliability and suitability of current generative search systems for high-stakes professional use \\\\cite{spatharioti2025effects}.Given these challenges, this work explores systematically integrating structured expert feedback at multiple stages of a generative search process, specifically query formulation, relevance judgments, and information extraction. We aim to shift the focus from full automation toward increased expert control and quality assurance. Our key research questions are:\\\\newline \\\\textbf{RQ1:} How can expert feedback be systematically integrated into GenAI-driven retrieval systems to improve result quality? \\\\newline \\\\textbf{RQ2:} How does a feedback-driven generative search system compare to fully automated approaches in terms of retrieval effectiveness and task performance?\\\\newline \\\\textbf{RQ3:} Does the integration of human expert feedback improve professional search outcomes compared to GenAI-simulated expert feedback?\\\\newline Building on our earlier experiments that assessed the performance of GenAI models in a fully automated setting for biomedical question answering \\\\cite{ateiakruschwitz} and introduced an interactive system for refining generated queries \\\\cite{ateia2025bioragent}, we now seek to evaluate how a structured, human-in-the-loop feedback approach might improve retrieval and task effectiveness over fully automated pipelines.

       "    'abstract': 'Effective information retrieval (IR) depends on accurate relevance classification.  But when the criteria are subjective or underspecified, small variations in classification can cause consequential shifts in retrieval results. The potential for such variability becomes critical for institutions when they use IR for research assessment. Retrieval instability can lead to relevant literature being overlooked, hindering a comprehensive understanding of the research landscape, and potentially undermining the validity of subsequent analyses and decisions. We investigate this problem within the context of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a global framework for addressing environmental, social, and economic challenges. Scholarly research is vital for understanding, implementing, and monitoring SDG progress. Universities report SDG-related research to demonstrate impact, and international rankings incorporate SDG alignment into evaluations, influencing funding, policy, and institutional strategy. However, the nuanced nature of the SDGs makes it difficult to define what constitutes an SDG contribution[1]. Commonly used Boolean queries and controlled vocabularies for SDG retrieval cannot reliably differentiate substantive contributions (based on semantic relevance) from mere term occurrences. In prior work, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used to filter Boolean search results in systematic reviews by scoring documents for relevance to a specific information need[2]. Other studies demonstrate that LLMs can generate high-quality relevance labels for IR evaluation[4]. This prompted an investigation into using LLMs to judge SDG contribution through relevance filtering, which revealed variability in the judgments made by different LLMs on the same set of documents[3]. This observation suggests that the classification behavior of LLMs are sensitive to the specific parameters inherent to each model. In this study, we prompt multiple LLMs to judge the SDG relevance of abstracts retrieved using Boolean queries. Abstracts judged relevant are used as positive training examples for fine-tuning multi-label SDG classifiers. We use these classifiers to simulate retrieval, applying fixed scoring functions to isolate fluctuations in ranking stability attributable to the different LLM relevance judgments. Our goal is to analyze how the structured signal of upstream inconsistencies in LLM-derived relevance judgments manifests as variations in retrieval outcomes, providing a novel lens for investigating ranking stability under classification uncertainty. This research centers on three key questions: RQ1: How do different LLMs diverge in their filtering decisions, and what effect does this have on ranking stability in retrieval systems trained on filtered data? RQ2: Can divergence in labeling decisions be systematically explained or predicted from document content? RQ3: What distinguishes documents where LLMs disagree on relevance, and can these differences be predicted from lexical or surface-level features? Using SDG classification as a case study of subjective relevance, we evaluate retrieval stability under classification uncertainty and address broader concerns regarding the reproducibility of LLM-based classification pipelines and their downstream effects.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency in Natural Language Generation (NLG) across various tasks. However, they often require additional resources beyond their internal knowledge to respond reliably to user queries. Determining the optimal methods, content, and timing for introducing new knowledge remains a critical challenge without clear solutions~\\\\cite{Soudani23Data}. Our main objective is to enhance knowledge injection in LLMs to generate trustworthy responses. Therefore, this research is centered around two main research questions. \\\\emph{\\\\textbf{(RQ1)} What are the most effective and efficient choices of knowledge injection for question-answering over less popular knowledge?} A key challenge in knowledge injection is determining how to introduce new knowledge into an LLM while balancing both effectiveness and efficiency~\\\\cite{Soudani24survey}. RAG and FT with synthetic data have emerged as two distinct paradigms, yet there has been no comprehensive comparison that highlights both their strengths and limitations~\\\\cite{Soudani24Fine}. To address this, we conduct an extensive evaluation of RAG and FT for handling less popular factual knowledge, assuming limited textual descriptions are available for a given domain and application. Through this analysis, we find that RAG substantially outperforms FT in this setup.Our second research question is: \\\\textit{(\\\\textbf{RQ2}) How can we quantify the uncertainty of LLMs during response generation and leverage it to improve the reliability of their outputs?} By knowing LLMs uncertainty, one can determine when to leverage RAG and when to rely solely on LLMs` internal knowledge. However, existing Uncertainty Estimation (UE) techniques primarily focus on scenarios where the input consists only of a user query, overlooking the complexities introduced by retrieved knowledge. We investigate UE in the context of RAG and find that the performance of current UE methods is inconsistent, often degrading when non-parametric knowledge is incorporated into the input prompt. We propose an axiomatic framework to formalize optimal behavior of UE methods.Recent advancements in active RAG aim to enhance the dynamic interaction between retrievers and generators~\\\\cite{Jiang23Active}. In this context, UE is primarily employed to determine when retrieval is necessary. Typically, uncertainty is measured based on next-token probabilities, and the interpretation of an uncertainty value is based on comparing it with accuracy. However, we raise three key questions: \\\\emph{\\\\textbf{(RQ2.1)} What is the optimal method for measuring uncertainty?} We argue that relying solely on probability-based methods may not be the most effective approach. Furthermore, in conversational systems, previous turns or sessions do not directly influence next-token probabilities, highlighting the need for a new UE method. \\\\emph{\\\\textbf{(RQ2.2)} How should uncertainty values be interpreted?} Current approaches, which define uncertainty through relative comparisons with other values, lack precision. Additionally, some applications correlate uncertainty with correctness, but how should uncertainty be interpreted in cases where correctness labels are unavailable?  Moreover, we aim to enhance conversational interactions by leveraging an appropriate UE method. Specifically, we will investigate the research question: \\\\emph{\\\\textbf{(RQ2.3)} Can an LLM anticipate its next action, identify its information needs, and then generate an appropriate response?} To explore this, we will utilize UE to help the LLM determine its next step, whether to generate a response, retrieve relevant information, ask a clarification question, or take an alternative action.',\n",

Here, we investigate whether offensive ads, when shown to search engine users, have such effects. We developed 12 search scenarios and created 4 versions of the search results page (SERP) for each scenario, where some of the ads were changed to be irrelevant and/or offensive. Crowdsourced judges found a strong correlation (>=0.63) between the reported number of annoying ads and the actual number of offensive and irrelevant ads, suggesting people conflate these attributes. Furthermore, we found that judges who assessed the SERPs for themselves reported lower positive affect and higher negative affect than judges asked to imagine the results were provided to someone else. In the latter case offensive ads also lead to slightly lower positive (-4%) and higher negative affect (+61%). Finally, in a recall test, only 6% of judges reported seeing an offensive ad when using search engines. Our work should further detract advertisers from using offensive ads since, in addition to previously documented adverse effects, such ads have a small but statistically significant negative effect on people’s emotional experience.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The growing memory demands of embedding tables in Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) pose great challenges for model training and deployment. Existing embedding compression solutions cannot simultaneously achieve memory efficiency, low latency, and adaptability to dynamic data distribution. This article presents CAFE+, a Compact, Adaptive, and Fast Embedding compression framework that meets the above requirements. The design philosophy of CAFE+ is to dynamically allocate more memory to important features and less to unimportant ones. We assign unique embedding to important feature and allow multiple unimportant features sharing one embedding. We propose a fast and lightweight feature monitor, to real-time capture feature importance and report important features. We theoretically analyze the accuracy of our feature monitor and prove the superiority of CAFE+ from the aspect of model convergence. Extensive experiments show CAFE+ outperforms existing embedding compression methods, yielding 3.94% and 3.94% superior testing AUC on Criteo Kaggle dataset and CriteoTB dataset at a compression ratio of 10,000 X. Building on our conference version [114], this journal version introduces several novel designs (implicit importance attenuation, adaptive threshold adjustment, and ColdSifter) that enable CAFE+ to more effectively adapt to long-term online learning and achieve better model quality.

       "    'abstract': 'Information Retrieval systems are becoming increasingly multimodal, and one interesting and natural modality for human information interaction is audio. Audio data is rapidly expanding in both volume and popularity. For example, more than 4 million podcasts are available worldwide – each containing tens to thousands of episodes – with over 500 million expected listeners as of 2024. Searching such large and evolving audio corpora involves multiple challenges, ranging from content and style diversity, expensive audio processing, and various indexing considerations such as retrieval segmentation and text vs audio retrieval modalities. In this thesis, we aim to address the challenges linked to audio retrieval and devise novel approaches to improve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. We divide the work into four main milestones that target answering the following research questions: RQ1: How does the quality of an ASR model affect retrieval effectiveness? One of the approaches to search spoken audio is to reduce the problem to text retrieval using ASR models to generate text transcripts. Spina et al. [2] showed that the quality of ASR has a clear impact on the summaries generated by ASR. Motivated by this, we are interested in examining how automatic transcription algorithms impact the effectiveness of audio retrieval and re-ranking in dense and sparse retrieval configurations. In many real-world scenarios, resource limits require cheaper ASR models to be used. Therefore, we are interested in exploring if dense semantic search methods can reduce the impact of ASR model choice. RQ2: How can we build more complete, comprehensive, and representative audio retrieval resources to promote further research on audio retrieval? After reviewing the literature and performing a preliminary experiment on the Spotify podcasts dataset [1], we noted two main gaps in the available resources. Firstly, the large audio dataset released in TREC suffers from the shallow pooling issue, where new systems retrieve many unseen judgments, making it difficult to assess the quality of modern IR techniques. Secondly, there is a scarcity of audio datasets available for low-resource languages. Our plan to bridge these gaps comprises two parts: (1) Assessing the missed judgments Motivated by the recent literature on using LLMs as a judge [3], we plan to resolve the unjudged passages issue by assessing the relevance with multiple large language models (LLMs). (2) Curate a multi-lingual audio dataset with a focus on low-resource languages. Since there is a scarcity of audio datasets in low-resource languages, we plan to collect a large number of audio files in multiple low-resource languages, unify their format, and make them publicly available as a first step toward building test collections that enable research and advancements in such languages. RQ3: How can we combine audio and text to produce an efficient and effective multi-modal ranking model? We will focus on solutions that depend on processing both text and audio signals during indexing and retrieval. Our first study will be focused on improving the effectiveness of low-cost ASR systems. Another promising direction is to use the phonetic features as a representation of a word or token. Then, we can devise a suitable indexing paradigm to support searching over these representations. RQ4: What are the challenges affecting audio indexing and search performance, and what is the best way to mitigate against similar issues in the future? One of the main challenges in multi-modal search is identifying the suitable length for the retrieval unit. The retrieval unit satisfying an information need might vary in length from a couple of minutes to 10 minutes to one hour or a whole episode or series. Other challenges will stem from failure cases within state-of-the-art text/audio retrieval systems. So, in parallel with answering the previous questions, we will also study such failure cases, investigate the reasons behind them, and propose solutions that can mitigate their negative impacts.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Sequential Recommendation (SR) aims to leverage the sequential patterns in users` historical interactions to accurately track their preferences. However, the primary reliance of existing SR methods on collaborative data results in challenges such as the cold-start problem and sub-optimal performance. Concurrently, despite the proven effectiveness of large language models (LLMs), their integration into commercial recommender systems is impeded by issues such as high inference latency, incomplete capture of all distribution statistics, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we introduce a novel Pre-train, Align, and Disentangle (PAD) framework to enhance SR models with LLMs. In particular, we initially pre-train both the SR and LLM models to obtain collaborative and textual embeddings. Subsequently, we propose a characteristic recommendation-anchored alignment loss using multi-kernel maximum mean discrepancy with Gaussian kernels. Lastly, a triple-experts architecture, comprising aligned and modality-specific experts with disentangled embeddings, is fine-tuned in a frequency-aware manner. Experimental results on three public datasets validate the efficacy of PAD, indicating substantial enhancements and compatibility with various SR backbone models, particularly for cold items.

       "    'abstract': 'Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to enhance the reliability of large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge.Existing RAG methods share a common strategy for knowledge injection: they place the retrieved documents into the input context of the LLM, which we refer to as the in-context knowledge injection method. While this approach is simple and often effective, it has inherent limitations. Firstly, increasing the context length and number of relevant documents can lead to higher computational overhead and degraded performance, especially in complex reasoning tasks. More importantly, in-context knowledge injection operates primarily at the input level, but LLMs store their internal knowledge in their parameters. This gap fundamentally limits the capacity of in-context methods. To this end, we introduce Parametric RAG, a new RAG paradigm that integrates external knowledge directly into the feed-forward networks of an LLM through document parameterization. This approach not only reduces online computational costs by shortening the input context length, but also deepens the integration of external knowledge by enabling LLMs to utilize it in the same way as internal parametric knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that Parametric RAG substantially enhances the effectiveness and efficiency of knowledge augmentation in LLMs. Also, it can be combined with in-context RAG methods to achieve even better performance.

       "    'abstract': 'The integration of artificial intelligence into healthcare holds immense potential to transform medical services through personalized care, early diagnosis, and more informed decision-making. However, despite significant advances in digital health technologies, the adoption of AI-driven systems remains limited, particularly in sensitive domains such as mental health, due to concerns around transparency, safety, and user trust. These concerns are compounded by the complexity of clinical language, the high stakes of decision-making, and the need for accountability in automated systems. This research addresses these challenges by investigating how Large Language Models (LLMs) and related techniques can be adapted to create explainable, interpretable, and safe health information systems. Positioned at the intersection of health informatics, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Information Retrieval (IR), this work explores both the potential and limitations of LLMs in clinical contexts. While LLMs are effective at processing large textual datasets and producing fluent responses, their black-box nature, tendency to hallucinate, and associated privacy risks make them unsuitable for direct application in healthcare without significant adaptation.This thesis proposes methodologies and systems focused on improving explanation generation, clinical relevance, and the safety of model outputs in health-related queries. The research is guided by eight specific goals: (1) Characterizing health-related language: Modeling the vocabulary used by individuals with specific health conditions using relevance-based statistical language models; (2) Generating natural language explanations: Designing interpretable models that explain classification outputs in ways meaningful to clinicians; (3) Adapting LLMs to clinical reasoning: Fine-tuning LLMs to reflect clinical workflows, particularly for retrieving symptom evidence and supporting diagnostic decisions; (4) Improving answer retrieval: Developing search systems for health queries with better result quality and contextual relevance; (5) Building health recommendation systems: Creating personalized tools for discovering reliable and relevant health information; (6) Ensuring safety and reliability: Creating ``guardrails`` to reduce hallucinations, biases, and misinformation in model outputs; and (7) Supporting multilingual and under-resourced settings: Extending solutions to diverse linguistic and cultural environments.Substantial progress has already been made. Goals G2 and G3 led to a Q1 journal publication on explainable depression detection using social media data, where we proposed and evaluated two architectures: a dual-model approach separating classification and explanation, and a unified LLM-based model that performs both tasks. For G4, we developed MindWell, a conversational agent for depression screening. Based on transformer models and grounded in the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), MindWell contextualizes user-generated content from social media to assist clinicians in identifying emotional patterns and symptoms. Ongoing work on G1 involves using statistical language models to identify lexical patterns linked to depressive behaviors online. For G7, we have trained an LLM adapted to Galician, an underrepresented co-official language in Spain, and are currently evaluating its performance in localized health information contexts.',\n",

This model learns a unified code representation by integrating comprehensive interactive information, including code text, OJ feedback scores, problem statement text, problem-skill correlations, and problem difficulties. IICE-PKT consists of three modules: Problem Representation module generates enhanced problem embeddings based on problem-skill correlations and problem difficulties; Code Representation module combines fine-tuned CodeBERT-based code text embeddings, GPT-generated problem text embeddings, and enhanced problem embeddings with supervised feedback scores to produce a unified code representation; Dual-Sequence Modeling module employs two independent GRUs to separately model the problem sequence and the code sequence. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of IICE-PKT. Ablation studies confirm that integrating interactive information into code representations significantly enhances effectiveness.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Open-set 3D object retrieval (3DOR) aims to learn discriminative and generalizable embeddings for unseen categories of 3D objects.  However, attaining this objective typically requires the costly acquisition of large-scale 3D object datasets and associated resources for model training.  Building upon the strong open-world representation capabilities of CLIP, we introduce CLIP-AdaM, which, to our knowledge, represents the first attempt to adapt a CLIP model for open-set 3DOR with minimal effort.  We first find that a pretrained CLIP already delivers a surprisingly acceptable performance on multi-view images.  To further unleash its potential, we design a customized adapter for learning to aggregate and adapt its pretrained features towards better 3D embeddings.  For aggregation, it learns two sets of view scores to weigh the contributions of view images for fusion. One is learned by a tiny view-score network at the instance level, and the other is learned implicitly at the dataset level, aiding generalization to unseen categories.  The adaptation component comprises only a basic linear layer yet yields superior results.  During training, the adapter with such a small amount of parameters can be efficiently fine-tuned with limited 3D closed-set data, effectively mitigating the overfitting issue while harnessing the prior knowledge from pretrained models.   Without bells and whistles, CLIP-AdaM attains state-of-the-art performance on four open-set 3DOR benchmarks. Additionally, it demonstrates strong extensibility to broader scenarios, including zero-shot, few-shot, and seen/unseen 3D representation learning.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'In click-through rate prediction, click-through rate prediction is used to model users` interests. However, most of the existing CTR prediction methods are mainly based on the ID modality. As a result, they are unable to comprehensively model users` multi-modal preferences. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce multi-modal CTR prediction. Although it seems appealing to directly apply the existing multi-modal fusion methods to click-through rate prediction models, these methods (1) fail to effectively disentangle commonalities and specificities across different modalities; (2) fail to consider the synergistic effects between modalities and model the complex interactions between modalities.  To address the above issues, this paper proposes the Diffusion-based Multi-modal Synergy Interest Network (Diff-MSIN) framework for click-through prediction. This framework introduces three innovative modules: the Multi-modal Feature Enhancement (MFE) Module Synergistic Relationship Capture (SRC) Module, and the Feature Dynamic Adaptive Fusion (FDAF) Module. The MFE Module and SRC Module extract synergistic, common, and special information among different modalities. They effectively enhances the representation of the modalities, improving the overall quality of the fusion. To encourage distinctiveness among different features, we design a Knowledge Decoupling method. Additionally, the FDAF Module focuses on capturing user preferences and reducing fusion noise. To validate the effectiveness of the Diff-MSIN framework, we conducted extensive experiments using the Rec-Tmall and three Amazon datasets. The results demonstrate that our approach yields a significant improvement of at least 1.67% compared to the baseline, highlighting its potential for enhancing multi-modal recommendation systems.

Existing methods generate new yet effective data during model training to improve performance. However, deploying them requires retraining, architecture modification, or introducing additional learnable parameters. These steps are time-consuming and costly for well-trained models, especially when the model scale becomes large. In this work, we explore the test-time augmentation (TTA) for sequential recommendation, which augments the inputs during the model inference and then aggregates the model`s predictions for augmented data to improve final accuracy. It avoids significant time and cost overhead from the previously mentioned steps. We first experimentally disclose the potential of existing augmentation operators for TTA and find that the Mask and Substitute consistently achieve better performance. Further analysis reveals that these two operators are effective because they retain the original sequential pattern while adding appropriate perturbations. Meanwhile, we argue that these two operators still face time-consuming item selection or interference information from mask tokens. Based on the analysis and limitations, we present TNoise and TMask. The former injects uniform noise into the original representation, avoiding the computational overhead of item selection. The latter blocks mask token from participating in model calculations or directly removes interactions that should have been replaced with mask tokens.

       "    'abstract': 'Modern recommender systems face a critical challenge in modeling the intricate interplay between multi-behavior interactions of users (e.g., clicks, adds-to-cart and purchases) and temporal dynamics that drive evolving preferences. While existing multi-behavior sequential recommendation methods attempt to capture these signals, they often suffer from fragmented modeling, such as decoupling behaviors and items into separate sequences, neglecting time-aware transitions, or relying on computationally intensive architectures that hinder real-world scalability. To address these limitations, we propose GEneralized Alternating Regressor (GEAR), a novel framework that unifies behaviors, items, and temporal contexts into a single autoregressive sequence through an alternating architecture. At its core, GEAR represents user interactions as triplets and processes them through a modular transformer architecture. In this architecture, each triplet is alternately modeled at lower layers to disentangle fine-grained patterns, while upper layers jointly learn cross-signal dependencies. This design mimics the interlocking mechanism of gears, enabling the seamless transitions between multi-behavior dynamics and item transitions. Additionally, we incorporate a time-bias term to quantify the decay of behavioral influence across both short- and long-term horizons. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness, generalizability, and computational efficiency of the proposed framework.',\n",

We introduce a novel framework for evaluating social bias in cross-modal retrieval systems, leveraging a new dataset and appropriate metrics specifically designed for this purpose. Our dataset, Social Inclusive Synthetic Professionals Images (SISPI), comprises 49K images generated using state-of-the-art text-to-image models, ensuring a balanced representation of demographic groups across various professional roles.

Secondly, the inevitable noise in MC ratings may hinder the recommendation quality of the model. To address the above issues, we propose a novel framework called Hyperbolic Multi-Criteria Recommendation (HMCR), which aims to mine users` MC behavioral features on hyperbolic manifolds and mitigate the noise interference through knowledge transfer among the criteria. Specifically, we map the representations on each criterion view to a hyperbolic space with adjustable curvature based on the Lorentz model, which is used to capture the hierarchical structure of collective user behavior. The MC preferences of individual users are fused by calculating the hyperbolic attention among each criterion and the overall rating. Moreover, we design a self-supervised contrastive loss to suppress the negative impact of noise interactions on the model.

In addition to recommendation accuracy, diversity is another critical aspect in evaluating SRSs. Recently, the emerging diffusion models (DMs) have been widely adopted in SRSs. Their employed learning-to-generate paradigm allows them to cover a much broader range of users` preferences and thus generate more diversified items. However, existing DM-based SRSs still face two significant gaps that prevent them from further improving the recommendation diversity: (1) they often rely on \\\\textbf{non-diversified users` preferences as guidance} to direct the training of diffusion networks, restricting networks` ability to generate diverse items; and (2) they are based on \\\\textbf{a homogeneous diffusion inference mechanism} to generate the next items and thus can only accommodate users` major preferences. Such a practice neglects users` heterogeneous preferences towards various types of items, further limiting recommendation diversity. To bridge these two critical gaps and to further unleash the potential of DMs in enhancing the recommendation diversity of SRSs, we propose a novel diversity-guided diffusion model for sequential recommendations, called \\\\textit{DiffDiv} for short. To be specific, first, a new diversity-aware guidance learning mechanism is devised to direct the training of DMs to effectively capture users` diversified preferences from  their historical interactions. Then, a novel heterogeneous diffusion inference mechanism is designed to generate diversified items to accommodate users` heterogeneous preferences, further boosting the recommendation diversity. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of DiffDiv in terms of both recommendation accuracy and diversity.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Logical reasoning-based recommendation methods employ logical rules to mitigate the adverse effects of noise items in short interaction sequences on recommendation accuracy. However, there are two problems with existing methods: 1) As the length of the interaction sequence increases, introducing more noise items exacerbates the negative impact on logical reasoning, thereby reducing the accuracy of these methods. 2) They are often dominated by the user`s single primary interest, which prevents simultaneous consideration of users` multiple-aspect interests in long sequences. To address these issues, we propose a novel dEnoising Multi-Interest-aware Logical rEasoning (EMILE) method for long-sequence recommendation. Specifically, we design a logical rule-based interest extractor that enhances the importance of preferred items in constructing user interests while minimizing the negative impact of disliked items. This extractor effectively mitigates the adverse effects of noise items in long interaction sequences. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-interest learning strategy that optimizes two new objective functions—interest probability distribution contrastive loss and interest logical reasoning contrastive loss—to ensure the model simultaneously considers multiple-aspect interests. These two objective functions require that the target item is more closely aligned with multiple interests than the single primary interest, both in the probability distribution space and during logical reasoning. Experimental results on four public datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms all compared baselines regarding recommendation accuracy.

To fill this gap, we propose LexRAG, the first benchmark to evaluate RAG systems for multi-turn legal consultations. LexRAG consists of 1,013 multi-turn dialogue samples and 17,228 candidate legal articles. Each sample is annotated by legal experts and consists of five rounds of progressive questioning.

This work presents ``X-Cross`` -- a novel cross-domain sequential-recommendation model that recommends products in new domains by integrating several domain-specific language models; each model is fine-tuned with low-rank adapters (LoRA). Given a recommendation prompt, operating layer by layer, X-Cross dynamically refines the representation of each source language model by integrating knowledge from all other models. These refined representations are propagated from one layer to the next, leveraging the activations from each domain adapter to ensure domain-specific nuances are preserved while enabling adaptability across domains. Using Amazon datasets for sequential recommendation, X-Cross achieves performance comparable to a model that is fine-tuned with LoRA, while using only 25% of the additional parameters. In cross-domain tasks, such as adapting from Toys domain to Tools, Electronics or Sports, X-Cross demonstrates robust performance, while requiring about 50%-75% less fine-tuning data than LoRA to make fine-tuning effective. Furthermore, X-Cross achieves significant improvement in accuracy over alternative cross-domain baselines. Overall, X-Cross enables scalable and adaptive cross-domain recommendations, reducing computational overhead and providing an efficient solution for data-constrained environments.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in knowledge-intensive tasks, yet their reasoning capabilities, particularly for complex multi-step reasoning, remain limited. Although recent approaches have explored integrating RAG with chain-of-thought reasoning or incorporating test-time search with process reward model (PRM), these methods face several untrustworthy challenges, including lack of explanations, bias in PRM training data, early-step bias in PRM scores, and ignoring post-training that fails to fully optimize reasoning potential. To address these issues, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning through Trustworthy Process Rewarding (ReARTeR), a framework that enhances RAG systems` reasoning capabilities through both post-training and test-time scaling. At test time, ReARTeR introduces Trustworthy Process Rewarding via a Process Reward Model for accurate scalar scoring and a Process Explanation Model (PEM) for generating natural language explanations, enabling step refinement. During post-training, we leverage Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by Trustworthy Process Rewarding to collect high-quality step-level preference data, which is used to optimize the model through Iterative Preference Optimization. ReARTeR tackles three key challenges: (1) misalignment between PRM and PEM, addressed through off-policy preference learning; (2) bias in PRM training data, mitigated by a balanced annotation method and incorporating stronger annotations for difficult examples; and (3) early-step bias in PRM, resolved via a temporal-difference-based look-ahead search strategy. Experimental results on multi-step reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ReARTeR significantly improves reasoning performance, highlighting its potential to advance the reasoning capability of RAG systems.',\n",

However, the quality of guidance is often compromised by unpredictable missing data in observed sequence, leading to suboptimal item generation. Since missing data is uncertain in both occurrence and content, recovering it is impractical and may introduce additional errors. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel dual-side Thompson sampling-based Diffusion Model (TDM), which simulates extra missing data in the guidance signals and allows diffusion models to handle existing missing data through extrapolation. To preserve user preference evolution in sequences despite extra missing data, we introduce Dual-side Thompson Sampling to implement simulation with two probability models, sampling by exploiting user preference from both item continuity and sequence stability. TDM strategically removes items from sequences based on dual-side Thompson sampling and treats these edited sequences as guidance for diffusion models, enhancing models` robustness to missing data through consistency regularization. Additionally, to enhance the generation efficiency, TDM is implemented under the denoising diffusion implicit models to accelerate the reverse process. Extensive experiments and theoretical analysis validate the effectiveness of TDM in addressing missing data in sequential recommendations.',\n",

Second, FairDiverse enables the evaluation of 29 fairness, and diversity algorithms across 16 base models for two fundamental IR tasks—search and recommendation—facilitating the establishment of a comprehensive benchmark. Finally, FairDiverse is highly extensible, offering multiple APIs to enable IR researchers to quickly develop their own fairness- and diversity-aware IR models, and allows for fair comparisons with existing baselines.

Given that real-world scenarios typically encounter unseen KGs with new entities and new relations, researchers have begun to explore fully inductive KGR methods. This setting presents greater challenges and has not been fully explored. Current methods primarily construct relation graphs based on the original KG to facilitate message passing between relations. These models have made significant progress in achieving fully inductive reasoning. However, as relation graphs focus solely on the co-occurrence patterns between relations, they often fail to capture reasoning patterns in KGs, which causes the model to struggle in effectively distinguishing between different relations and entities. This limitation severely restrict the reasoning capabilities of existing methods.In light of this, we propose the \\\\textbf{Ada}ptive \\\\textbf{R}ule \\\\textbf{P}attern \\\\textbf{T}ransfer model (AdaRPT) for KGR. It aims to leverage logical rules for each relation in the KG to learn more comprehensive and transferable knowledge representations for entities and relations. For entities, we design a non-parameter message passing model that aggregates path information from the query entity to other entities. The path information for each entity is then matched with rules to obtain the transferable feature of each entity. And for relations, we extract both reasoning and co-occurrence patterns from KGs as transferable relation features. Finally, a path-based graph neural network (GNN) is employed on the transferable features of entities and relations to perform reasoning on KGs. Extensive experimental evaluations on 43 datasets for both inductive and transductive reasoning demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capability of AdaRPT.',\n",

Traditional RS evaluation methods primarily focus on the user`s immediate feedback (e.g., click), however, they often overlook the long-term effect involved by the content creators. In the real world, content creators can strategically create and upload new items to the platform by analyzing users` feedback and preference trends. Although previous studies have attempted to model creator behaviors, they often overlook that such behaviors are under conditions of information asymmetry. This asymmetry arises because creators mainly access the user feedback on the items they produce, while the platform has access to the full spectrum of feedback data. However, existing RS simulators often fail to consider such a condition, making the long-term RS evaluation inaccurate.  To bridge this gap, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-empowered creator simulation agent named CreAgent. By utilizing the belief mechanism from game theory and the fast-and-slow thinking framework, we can simulate the creator`s behaviors well under information asymmetry. Furthermore, to enhance CreAgent`s simulation ability, we utilize Proximal Policy Optimization to fine-tune CreAgent. Our credibility validation experiments demonstrate that our simulation environment effectively aligns with the behaviors of real-world platforms and creators, thereby enhancing the reliability of long-term evaluations in RS. Furthermore, leveraging this simulator, we can examine whether RS algorithms, such as fairness- and diversity-aware methods, contribute to improving long-term performance for different stakeholders.',\n",

However, existing approaches implicitly model users` preferences through fitting the fine-grained labels (e.g., click labels), but often neglecting the coarse-grained interest information inherent in the inputs themselves. Relying solely on the fine-grained labels could bring negative impact on interest modeling and limit the performance, as the labels may carry inevitable noise in real-world scenarios. In addition, it is considerably demanding in terms of data for most existing approaches to effectively model users` multi-granularity interests with limited or no supporting examples, resulting in subpar performance due to the significant long-tail phenomenon. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel learning framework named the Multi-Granularity Interest Prediction Framework (MGIPF), for better modeling users` diverse interests. Unlike prior work, our key idea is to utilize both the coarse-grained and fine-grained interests for supervising the training of models. Specifically, we introduce a pseudo-labeling approach explicitly mining users` potential multi-granularity interests from the raw data, and propose coarse-grained interest prediction modules that collaborate to utilize the multi-granularity supervision signals to enhance the learning of low-frequency items. The corresponding coarse-grained losses are softly weighted, taking into account the varying confidence of potential multi-granularity preferences on positive and negative samples. Importantly, our framework is lightweight and adaptable, capable of being applied effectively to mainstream recommendation models, establishing a comprehensive end-to-end training process.

       "    'abstract': 'This paper investigates the potential of vision-language models (VLMs) in addressing the challenges of universal cross-domain retrieval (UCDR), where queries originate from unseen domains or classes. A common approach to adapting VLMs for downstream tasks involves prompt tuning, which alleviates the computational burden of full fine-tuning. However, this approach often struggles with the domain and semantic shifts inherent in UCDR. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel prompt decoupling strategy that separates prompts into universal domain prompts (UDPs) and class prompts (CPs). Specifically, UDPs are designed to unify features from both seen and unseen domains into a cohesive universal domain, while CPs are tailored to capture class-specific visual characteristics, enabling robust retrieval across both known and unknown classes. To ensure effective decoupling, we introduce a dedicated decoupling loss that enforces the domain-agnostic nature of CPs. Additionally, we employ a regulation loss to align features from the frozen CLIP domain with those of the universal domain by selectively integrating or excluding UDPs. This mechanism fosters a synergistic domain ensemble effect, enhancing retrieval generalization across diverse domains. Finally, we propose the domain-aware triplet-hard (DaTri) loss to mitigate overfitting by reducing the risk of class collapse. The proposed framework, referred to as Domain Ensemble using Decoupled Prompts (DePro), demonstrates state-of-the-art performance and effectively enhances the model`s generalization capacity across unseen domains and classes, as validated through extensive experiments. Code is here.',\n",

However, this rise is accompanied by issues such as the spread of misinformation and online rumors. Community Level Information Pathway Prediction (CLIPP) is proposed to effectively stop the propagation of harmful information within specific communities. While progress has been made in understanding user-level propagation, there is a significant gap in addressing the CLIPP problem at the community level, particularly with regard to social context interpretation and the cold start problem in niche communities. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel model, named Community-Level Propagation Prediction with LLM enhanced Social Context Interpretation and Community Coldstart (ComPaSC3), which integrates three primary modules. The video enhancement module leverages LLMs to enrich the interpretation of multimedia content by embedding world knowledge. The community portrait building module utilizes LLMs to generate detailed community portraits for community interpretation. To tackle the community cold start problem, the dynamic commLink module links non-popular communities to the popular ones based on their portrait similarity, and dynamically updates their relationship weights. Our experimental results demonstrate that ComPaSC3 significantly improves predictive accuracy in both popular and non-popular scenarios. Particularly in non-popular communities, our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving improvements of 10.00% - 15.20% in Rec@5 and 7.31% - 12.32% in NDCG@10.',\n",

To address this limitation, we present LUSIFER, a novel zero-shot approach that adapts LLM-based embedding models for multilingual tasks without requiring multilingual supervision. LUSIFER`s architecture combines a multilingual encoder, serving as a language-universal learner, with an LLM-based embedding model optimized for embedding-specific tasks. These components are seamlessly integrated through a minimal set of trainable parameters that act as a connector, effectively transferring the multilingual encoder`s language understanding capabilities to the specialized embedding model. Additionally, to comprehensively evaluate multilingual embedding performance, we introduce a new benchmark encompassing 5 primary embedding tasks, 123 diverse datasets, and coverage across 14 languages. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that LUSIFER significantly enhances the multilingual performance across various embedding tasks, particularly for medium and low-resource languages, without requiring explicit multilingual training data.

While traditional approaches often suffer from data sparsity and limited information sharing between objectives, recent methods utilizing a shared network alongside dedicated sub-networks for each objective partially address these limitations. However, such methods significantly increase the model parameters, leading to an increased retrieval latency and a limited ability to model causal relationships between objectives. To address these challenges, we propose the Cascaded Selective Mask Fine-Tuning (CSMF), a novel method that enhances both retrieval efficiency and serving performance for multi-objective EBR. The CSMF framework selectively masks model parameters to free up independent learning space for each objective, leveraging the cascading relationships between objectives during the sequential fine-tuning. Without increasing network parameters or online retrieval overhead, CSMF computes a linearly weighted fusion score for multiple objective probabilities while supporting flexible adjustment of each objective`s weight across various recommendation scenarios.

       "    'abstract': 'Recommender systems are essential for information access, allowing users to present their content for recommendation. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), AI-generated content (AIGC), primarily in the form of text, has become a central part of the content ecosystem. As AIGC becomes increasingly prevalent, it is important to understand how it affects the performance and dynamics of recommender systems. To this end, we construct an environment that incorporates AIGC to explore its short-term impact. The results from popular sequential recommendation models reveal that AIGC are ranked higher in the recommender system, reflecting the phenomenon of source bias. To further explore the long-term impact of AIGC, we introduce a feedback loop with realistic simulators. The results show that the model`s preference for AIGC increases as the user clicks on AIGC rises and the model trains on simulated click data. This leads to two issues: In the short term, bias toward AIGC encourages LLM-based content creation, increasing AIGC content, and causing unfair traffic distribution. From a long-term perspective, our experiments also show that when AIGC dominates the content ecosystem after a feedback loop, it can lead to a decline in recommendation performance. To address these issues, we propose a debiasing method based on L1-loss optimization to maintain long-term content ecosystem balance. In a real-world environment with AIGC generated by mainstream LLMs, our method ensures a balance between AIGC and human-generated content in the ecosystem.

       "    'abstract': 'To evaluate multi-query sessions, recent studies usually add a second ``session`` dimension to the query-level evaluation framework, deriving corresponding session-version evaluation metrics such as sDCG, sRBP, and sINST. However, these existing metrics do not sufficiently consider the different impacts of users` expectations of gains and costs on their behaviors such as query reformulation, nor the bounded rationality characteristic of users in expectation management. To address these issues and better explain user behavior in multi-query sessions, we design a user model based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), which links user expectations to user behaviors. Within the TPB framework, we propose sTPB, a new measure that adapts to users` expectation management modes by considering users` expectations of gains and costs. To demonstrate the effectiveness of sTPB in evaluating multi-query sessions, we compare it with existing session metrics on two publicly available user search behavior datasets. The results show that sTPB significantly outperforms other metrics in terms of both fitting user behavior and measuring user satisfaction. Additionally, we explore the differences between optimal parameters under different user characteristics and task types in session search evaluation. We find that different user characteristics and task types lead to various preferences in users` choices between continuing to examine results and reformulating queries. Our study not only validates the effectiveness of sTPB in evaluating multi-query sessions but also highlights the necessity of considering the influence of user characteristics and task types when designing metrics.',\n",

Both approaches, whether relying on serialization or using SQL-like operations as an intermediary, encounter difficulties in fully capturing structural relationships and effectively handling sparse data. To address these unique characteristics of structured data, we propose HyperG, a hypergraph-based generation framework aimed at enhancing LLMs` ability to process structured knowledge.

Existing approaches typically employ rule-based strategies or Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques. However, rule-based strategies lack the flexibility to adapt to time-varying market conditions, and RL-based methods struggle to capture essential historical dependencies and observations within Markov Decision Process (MDP) frameworks. Furthermore, these approaches often face challenges in ensuring strategy adaptability across diverse advertising objectives. Additionally, as offline training methods are increasingly adopted to facilitate the deployment and maintenance of stable online strategies, the issues of documented behavioral patterns and behavioral collapse resulting from training on fixed offline datasets become increasingly significant.To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel offline Generative Auto-bidding framework with Value-Guided Explorations (GAVE).

These models project pieces of text into a latent space, describing them in terms of shared latent concepts, which are not explicitly tied to the text`s content.   Previous work has shown that certain dimensions of such dense text representations can be irrelevant and detrimental to retrieval effectiveness depending on the information need specified in the query.   Higher effectiveness can be achieved by performing retrieval within a linear subspace that excludes these dimensions.   Dimension IMportance Estimators (DIMEs) are models designed to identify such harmful dimensions, refining the representations of queries and documents to retain only the useful ones.  Current DIMEs rely either on pseudo-relevance feedback, which often delivers inconsistent effectiveness, or on explicit relevance feedback, which is challenging to collect.  Inspired by counterfactual modelling, we introduce Counterfactual DIMEs (CoDIMEs), designed to leverage noisy implicit feedback to assess the importance of each dimension.  The CoDIME framework presented here approximates the relationship between a document`s click frequency and its interaction with a given query dimension through a linear model. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that CoDIME outperforms traditional pseudo-relevance feedback-based DIMEs and surpasses other unsupervised counterfactual methods that utilize implicit feedback.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Considering the inherent limitations of parametric knowledge in large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is widely employed to expand their knowledge scope. Since RAG has shown promise in knowledge-intensive tasks like open-domain question answering, its broader application to complex tasks and intelligent assistants has further advanced its utility. Despite this progress, the underlying knowledge utilization mechanisms of LLM-based RAG remain underexplored. In this paper, we present a systematic investigation of the intrinsic mechanisms by which LLMs integrate internal (parametric) and external (retrieved) knowledge in RAG scenarios. Specially, we employ knowledge stream analysis at the macroscopic level, and investigate the function of individual modules at the microscopic level. Drawing on knowledge streaming analyses, we decompose the knowledge utilization process into four distinct stages within LLM layers: knowledge refinement, knowledge elicitation, knowledge expression, and knowledge contestation. We further demonstrate that the relevance of passages guides the streaming of knowledge through these stages. At the module level, we introduce a new method, knowledge activation probability entropy (KAPE) for neuron identification associated with either internal or external knowledge. By selectively deactivating these neurons, we achieve targeted shifts in the LLM’s reliance on one knowledge source over the other. Moreover, we discern complementary roles for multi-head attention and multi-layer perceptron layers during knowledge formation. These insights offer a foundation for improving interpretability and reliability in retrieval-augmented LLMs, paving the way for more robust and transparent generative solutions in knowledge-intensive domains.',\n",

We present three key contributions to address this gap. First, we rigorously define listwise feature attribution for ranking models. Secondly, we introduce RankingSHAP, extending the popular SHAP framework to accommodate listwise ranking attribution, addressing a significant methodological gap in the field. Third, we propose two novel evaluation paradigms for assessing the faithfulness of attributions in learning-to-rank models, measuring the correctness and completeness of the explanation with respect to different aspects. Through experiments on standard learning-to-rank datasets, we demonstrate RankingSHAP’s practical application while identifying the constraints of selection-based explanations. We further employ a simulated study with an interpretable model to showcase how listwise ranking attributions can be used to examine model decisions and conduct a qualitative evaluation of explanations.

       "    'abstract': 'The past few years have witnessed a growing interest in LLM-based recommender systems (RSs), although their industrial deployment remains in a preliminary stage. Most existing deployments leverage LLMs offline as feature enhancers, generating augmented knowledge for downstream tasks. However, in recommendation scenarios with numerous users and items, even offline knowledge generation with LLMs demands significant time and computational resources. This inefficiency arises from the autoregressive nature of LLMs. A promising solution is speculative decoding, a Draft-Then-Verify approach that increases the number of tokens generated per decoding step.In this work, we first identify recommendation knowledge generation as a highly fitting use case for retrieval-based speculative decoding. Then, we discern its two characteristics: (1) the vast number of items and users in RSs leads to retrieval inefficiency, and (2) RSs exhibit high diversity tolerance for LLM-generated text. Building on these insights, we introduce Lossless Acceleration via Speculative Decoding for LLM-based Recommender Systems (LASER), which features a Customized Retrieval Pool to enhance retrieval efficiency and Relaxed Verification to improve the acceptance rate of draft tokens. LASER achieves a 3-5x speedup on public datasets and saves about 67\\\\% of computational resources during the online A/B test on a large-scale advertising scenario with lossless downstream recommendation performance.

       "    'abstract': 'Fairness is an increasingly important factor in re-ranking tasks. Prior work has identified a trade-off between ranking accuracy and item fairness. However, the underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. An analogy can be drawn between re-ranking and the dynamics of economic transactions. The accuracy-fairness trade-off parallels the coupling of the commodity tax transfer process. Fairness considerations in re-ranking, similar to a commodity tax on suppliers, ultimately translate into a cost passed on to consumers. Analogously, item-side fairness constraints result in a decline in user-side accuracy. In economics, the extent to which commodity tax on the supplier (item fairness) transfers to commodity tax on users (accuracy loss) is formalized using the notion of elasticity. The re-ranking fairness-accuracy trade-off is similarly governed by the elasticity of utility between item groups. This insight underscores the limitations of current fair re-ranking evaluations, which often rely solely on a single fairness metric, hindering comprehensive assessment of fair re-ranking algorithms.    Centered around the concept of elasticity, this work presents two significant contributions. We introduce the Elastic Fairness Curve (EF-Curve) as an evaluation framework. This framework enables a comparative analysis of algorithm performance across different elasticity levels, facilitating the selection of the most suitable approach.  Furthermore, we propose ElasticRank, a fair re-ranking algorithm that employs elasticity calculations to adjust inter-item distances within a curved space.

       "    'abstract': 'In sequential recommendation, system exposure refers to items that are exposed to the user. Typically, the user only interactions with a few of the exposed items. Although sequential recommendation has achieved great success in predicting future user interests, existing sequential recommendation methods do not fully exploit system exposure data. Most methods only model items that have been interacted with, while the large volume of exposed but non-interacted items is overlooked. Even methods that consider system exposure typically train the recommender using only the logged historical system exposure, without exploring unseen user interests. In this paper, we propose counterfactual augmentation over system exposure for sequential recommendation (CaseRec). To better model historical system exposure, CaseRec introduces reinforcement learning to account for different exposure rewards. CaseRec uses a decision transformer-based sequential model to take an exposure sequence as input and assigns different rewards according to the user feedback. To explore unseen user interests, CaseRec performs counterfactual augmentation, where exposed items are replaced with counterfactual items. Then, a transformer based user simulator is used to predict the user feedback reward for the augmented items. Augmentation, together with the user simulator, gives rise to counterfactual exposure sequences to uncover new user interests. Finally, CaseRec uses the logged exposure sequences with the counterfactual exposure sequences to train a decision transformer-based sequential model for generating recommendation. Experiments on three real-world benchmarks show the effectiveness of CaseRec. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZiqiZhao1/CaseRec.',\n",

Beyond user requests to remove specific interactions due to privacy concerns or preference changes, regulatory frameworks mandate recommender systems` ability to eliminate the influence of certain user data from models. This recommendation unlearning challenge presents unique difficulties as removing connections within interaction graphs creates ripple effects throughout the model, potentially impacting recommendations for numerous users. Traditional approaches suffer from significant drawbacks: fragmentation methods damage graph structure and diminish performance, while influence function techniques make assumptions that may not hold in complex GNNs, particularly with self-supervised or random architectures. To address these limitations, we propose a novel model-agnostic pre-training paradigm UnlearnRec that prepares systems for efficient unlearning operations. Our Influence Encoder takes unlearning requests together with existing model parameters and directly produces updated parameters of unlearned model with little fine-tuning, avoiding complete retraining while preserving model performance characteristics. Extensive evaluation on public benchmarks demonstrates that our method delivers exceptional unlearning effectiveness while providing more than 10x speedup compared to retraining approaches.

       "    'abstract': 'Reliable factuality evaluation is critical for the iterative development of open-domain question answering (ODQA) systems, especially given the rise of large language models (LLMs) and their propensity for hallucination. However, state-of-the-art (SOTA) automatic metrics, which are mostly supervised, remain notably less reliable than humans. In this paper, we find two key challenges behind this gap: (1) length distribution mismatch between lengthy LLM answers and shorter training answers used by current metrics; and (2) reference incompleteness, where current metrics often misjudge valid system answers absent from given references—a challenge worsened by the diversity of LLM outputs. To address these issues, we present a new ODQA factuality evaluation dataset called OBELLA (Open-Book Evaluation for Long-form LLM Answers). OBELLA narrows the length distribution mismatch by significantly increasing the candidate answer length to align with LLM outputs. Moreover, it introduces a neutral class for plausible yet under-supported candidate answers to differentiate reference incompleteness from outright incorrectness, thus enabling flexible reevaluation by consulting external knowledge for more references. Based on OBELLA, we propose a novel metric named OBELLAM (OBELLA Metric). OBELLAM integrates a cross-attention mechanism to enhance long-form candidate answer representations and employs a dynamic closed–open book evaluation strategy to tackle reference incompleteness. Our OBELLAM sets a new SOTA in aligning with human judgments across two ODQA evaluation benchmarks, marking a promising step toward more robust ODQA factuality evaluation.',\n",

Existing contrastive learning-based sequential recommendation works primarily utilize heuristic data augmentation methods, which often exhibit excessive randomness and struggle to generate positive samples that align with users` true intentions. To address this limitation, we propose Triplet Contrastive learning with Learnable sequence Augmentation for sequential Recommendation (TCLARec). Unlike heuristic or rule-based augmentation methods, we train a learnable sequence augmentation module that can automatically leverage the self-supervised information from global context to select appropriate modification positions and augmentation operations, thereby generating positive samples that more accurately reflect user preferences. Furthermore, we design a ranking-based triplet contrastive loss to enhance the positive feedback from augmented sequence generated by the augmentation module, providing more nuanced contrastive signals for model optimization.

To mitigate the impact of noise, many existing methods rely on small-loss sample selection to filter out clean samples.

To tackle this issue, we propose a novel method, named the Meta Similarity Importance Assignment Network (MSIAN), to achieve robust cross-modal retrieval. MSIAN employs a meta-learning strategy to dynamically learn the importance of each sample through a two-level optimization process. With adaptively guiding the learning process, MSIAN adjusts the importance weight of each sample based on its inherent trustworthiness. Thereby, thus iterative mechanism progressively shifts the network`s focus on the most reliable data points, amplifying the impact of credible samples while diminishing the adaptive weight of noisy ones. Furthermore, MSIAN dynamically adapts the soft margin of each sample through continuously updated adaptive weights, thereby improving the robustness of the model.

This capability benefits various downstream information retrieval (IR) tasks. The primary challenge lies in enabling models to generalize effectively to unseen relation categories. Existing approaches typically leverage the knowledge embedded in pre-trained language models to accomplish the generalization process. However, these methods focus solely on fitting the training data during training, without specifically improving the model`s generalization performance, resulting in limited generalization capability. For this reason, we explore the integration of bi-level optimization (BLO) with pre-trained language models for learning generalized knowledge directly from the training data, and propose a generative meta-learning framework which exploits the `learning-to-learn` ability of meta-learning to boost the generalization capability of generative models. Specifically, we introduce a BLO approach that simultaneously addresses data fitting and generalization. This is achieved by constructing an upper-level loss to focus on generalization and a lower-level loss to ensure accurate data fitting. Building on this, we subsequently develop three generative meta-learning methods, each tailored to a distinct category of meta-learning.

To this end, we propose VoRec, a novel framework that explores the spatial distribution of items and their associated tags to achieve accurate recommendations in hyperbolic space. Specifically, we employ the Voronoi diagram to partition hyperbolic space into logically related subspaces, based on tag distributions and relationships derived from existing tag taxonomies. In addition, we combine the Voronoi diagram with the Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Network (HGCN) and exploit the respective advantages of the Poincaré and Lorentz models in hyperbolic space. Finally, we develop two types of Voronoi site update strategies, namely active and passive ones, to optimize the Voronoi diagram for recommendation tasks. The active strategy employs contrastive learning to guide updates to the Voronoi diagram, while the passive strategy adaptively freezes parameters based on information gain to regulate the update rate. Extensive experiments on four real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed VoRec framework delivers substantial performance improvements, achieving an average 16.35% enhancement in Recall and NDCG metrics compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Typically, existing RED methods learn from limited semantics in early comments.

Traditional functions for computing the distance between sequences are often based on dynamic programming to find a globally optimal alignment, which has quadratic complexity and is difficult to parallelize, thus limiting their application in large-scale datasets with long sequences. To solve this problem, various fields have designed some specialized models to approximate these distance functions inspired by deep representation learning, i.e., projecting the sequence into a geometric embedding space through an embedding function, so that the distance between sequences can be approximated by the distance in the high-dimensional embedding space, thereby reducing the quadratic complexity to linear.  However, we note that even though the element types in sequence and distance functions are different across various fields, the core problem that needs to be solved remains the same. In this paper, we attempt to unify the sequence distance computation approximation from various fields and propose GnesDA. Specifically, we first unify the input representation of sequences in which the element type is the symbol and numeric values. We then encode the sequence using a convolutional block and a Transformer block sequentially, which can effectively capture local patterns and long dependencies respectively. Extensive experiments on four distance functions as well as four large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that GnesDA achieves state-of-the-art in terms of both versatility and effectiveness.

Existing approaches to MIPS either rely solely on Inner Product (IP) similarity, which faces issues with local optima and redundant computations, or reduce the MIPS problem to the Nearest Neighbor Search under the Euclidean metric via space projection, leading to topology destruction and information loss. Despite the divergence of the two paradigms, we argue that there is no inherent binary opposition between IP and Euclidean metrics. By stitching IP and Euclidean in the design of indexing and search algorithms, we can significantly enhance MIPS performance. Specifically, this paper explores the theoretical and empirical connections between these two metrics from the MIPS perspective. Our investigation, grounded in graph-based search, reveals that different indexing and search strategies offer distinct advantages for MIPS, depending on the underlying data topology. Building on these insights, we introduce a novel graph-based index called Metric-Amphibious Graph (MAG) and a corresponding search algorithm, Adaptive Navigation with Metric Switch (ANMS). To facilitate parameter tuning for optimal performance, we identify three statistical indicators that capture essential data topology properties and correlate strongly with parameter tuning.

Collaborative filtering is the major paradigm in recommendation systems. Based on user-item interaction data, collaborative filtering recommends items to a user based on other similar users. The problem of interest disentanglement in recommendation now has attracted the attention of many researchers. Several works have proposed methods to disentangle conformity from user private interest, by assuming that conformity is correlated to item popularity. However, such modeling is simplistic and overlooks many possibilities between user public and private interest, and the item popularity. For example, a user can privately like a popular movie or buy a niche music album due to the stimulation of the social environment. In this paper, we propose a more comprehensive social behavior model that describes fine-grained relationships between user interest and item popularity. Our model does not use explicit user relationship data. Instead, we extract social behavior patterns directly from user-item interaction data. We also make our model into a recommendation framework called Disentangled Social Consumer Preference (DSCP), which can be integrated into existing recommendation models such as BPRMF. Our extensive experiments with four datasets from different services show that our model can outperform state-of-the-art baseline models.

       "    'abstract': 'Robustness and Effectiveness are critical aspects of developing dense retrieval models for real-world applications. It is known that there is a trade-off between the two. Recent work has addressed scaling laws of effectiveness in dense retrieval, revealing a power-law relationship between effectiveness and the size of models and data. Does robustness follow scaling laws too? If so, can scaling improve both robustness and effectiveness together, or do they remain locked in a trade-off? To answer these questions, we conduct a comprehensive experimental study. We find that: (i) Robustness, including out-of-distribution and adversarial robustness, also follows a scaling law. (ii) Robustness and effectiveness exhibit different scaling patterns, leading to significant resource costs when jointly improving both. Given these findings, we shift to the third factor that affects model performance, namely the optimization strategy, beyond the model size and data size. We find that: (i) By fitting different optimization strategies, the joint performance of robustness and effectiveness traces out a Pareto frontier. (ii) When the optimization strategy strays from Pareto efficiency, the joint performance scales in a sub-optimal direction. (iii) By adjusting the optimization weights to fit the Pareto efficiency, we can achieve Pareto training, where the scaling of joint performance becomes most efficient. Even without requiring additional resources, Pareto training is comparable to the performance of scaling resources several times under optimization strategies that overly prioritize either robustness or effectiveness. Finally, we demonstrate that our findings can help deploy dense retrieval models in real-world applications that scale efficiently and are balanced for robustness and effectiveness.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'People`s daily lives involve numerous periodic behaviors, such as eating and traveling. Local-life platforms cater to these recurring needs by providing essential services tied to daily routines. Therefore, users` periodic intentions are reflected in their interactions with the platforms. There are two main challenges in modeling users` periodic behaviors in the local-life service recommendation systems: 1) the diverse demands of users exhibit varying periodicities, which are difficult to distinguish as they are mixed in the behavior sequences; 2) the periodic behaviors of users are subject to dynamic changes due to factors such as holidays and promotional events. Existing methods struggle to distinguish the periodicities of diverse demands and overlook the importance of dynamically capturing changes in users` periodic behaviors. To this end, we employ a Frequency-Aware Multi-View Interest Modeling framework (FIM). Specifically, we propose a multi-view search strategy that decomposes users` demands from different perspectives to separate their various periodic intentions. This allows the model to comprehensively extract their periodic features than category-searched-only methods. Moreover, we propose a frequency-domain perception and evolution module. This module uses the Fourier Transform to convert users` temporal behaviors into the frequency domain, enabling the model to dynamically perceive their periodic features. Extensive offline experiments demonstrate that FIM achieves significant improvements on public and industrial datasets, showing its capability to effectively model users` periodic intentions. Furthermore, the model has been deployed on the Kuaishou local-life service platform. Through online A/B experiments, the transaction volume has been significantly improved.',\n",

However, two key challenges remain insufficiently addressed: (1) Insufficient consideration of missing modality scenarios and (2) the overlooking of unique characteristics of modality features. These challenges result in significant performance degradation in realistic situations where modalities are missing. To address these issues, we propose Disentangling and Generating Modality Recommender (DGMRec), a novel framework tailored for missing modality scenarios. DGMRec disentangles modality features into general and specific modality features from an information-based perspective, enabling richer representations for recommendation. Building on this, it generates missing modality features by integrating aligned features from other modalities and leveraging user modality preferences. Extensive experiments show that DGMRec consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MRSs in challenging scenarios, including missing modalities and new item settings as well as diverse missing ratios and varying levels of missing modalities. Moreover, DGMRec`s generation-based approach enables cross-modal retrieval, a task inapplicable for existing MRSs, highlighting its adaptability and potential for real-world applications.

       "    'abstract': 'Recommendation algorithms rely on user historical interactions to deliver personalized suggestions, which raises significant privacy concerns. Federated recommendation algorithms tackle this issue by combining local model training with server-side model aggregation, where most existing algorithms use a uniform weighted summation to aggregate item embeddings from different client models. This approach has three major limitations: 1) information loss during aggregation, 2) failure to retain personalized local features, and 3) incompatibility with parameter-free recommendation algorithms. To address these limitations, we first review the development of recommendation algorithms and recognize that their core function is to share collaborative information, specifically the global relationship between users and items. With this understanding, we propose a novel aggregation paradigm named collaborative information aggregation, which focuses on sharing collaborative information rather than item parameters. Based on this new paradigm, we introduce the federated collaborative information aggregation (FedCIA) method for privacy-preserving recommendation. This method requires each client to upload item similarity matrices for aggregation, which allows clients to align their local models without constraining embeddings to a unified vector space. As a result, it mitigates information loss caused by direct summation, preserves the personalized embedding distributions of individual clients, and supports the aggregation of parameter-free models. Theoretical analysis and experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of FedCIA compared with the state-of-the-art federated recommendation algorithms.

       "    'abstract': 'Recent works in multimodal recommendations, which leverage diverse modal information to address data sparsity and enhance recommendation accuracy, have garnered considerable interest. Two key processes in multimodal recommendations are modality fusion and representation learning. Previous approaches in modality fusion often employ simplistic attentive or pre-defined strategies at early or late stages, failing to effectively handle irrelevant information among modalities. In representation learning, prior research has constructed heterogeneous and homogeneous graph structures encapsulating user-item, user-user, and item-item relationships to better capture user interests and item profiles. Modality fusion and representation learning were considered as two independent processes in previous work. This paper reveals that these two processes are complementary and can support each other. Specifically, powerful representation learning enhances modality fusion, while effective fusion improves representation quality. Stemming from these two processes, we introduce a COmposite grapH convolutional nEtwork with dual-stage fuSION for the multimodal recommendation, named COHESION. Specifically, it introduces a dual-stage fusion strategy to reduce the impact of irrelevant information, refining all modalities using behavior modality in the early stage and fusing their representations at the late stage. It also proposes a composite graph convolutional network that utilizes user-item, user-user, and item-item graphs to extract heterogeneous and homogeneous latent relationships within users and items. Besides, it introduces a novel adaptive optimization to ensure balanced and reasonable representations across modalities. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the significant superiority of COHESION over various competitive baselines.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'In the era of big data and AI, recommender systems must adapt to evolving user preferences and new users/items to maintain high-quality recommendations. Fine-tuning, which updates model parameters using only new data, offers an efficient alternative to full retraining but struggles to balance stability (retaining past knowledge) and plasticity (adapting to new knowledge). While existing methods prioritize stability to address catastrophic forgetting, we argue that plasticity must also be explicitly strengthened, especially for users with rapidly changing preferences. In this work, we propose PlastIcity and StAbility balancing continual recommender systems (PISA), a novel framework that adaptively balances stability and plasticity based on user preference shifts. PISA quantifies preference shifts as changes in user distances to item clusters, and then guides user embeddings by prioritizing stability for stable users and plasticity for dynamic users. To achieve this, PISA leverages backward knowledge from the previous model and forward knowledge from fine-tuning on current data. During training, PISA maximizes mutual information between user-specific parameters and the relevant reference knowledge. Theoretically, we show thatenhancing plasticity mitigates distribution shifts more effectively than fine-tuning alone. Empirically, extensive experiments on three real-world datasets validate PISA’s superiority over existing methods and highlight the contributions of its components.',\n",

In this paper, we aim to extract these key concepts and contributions from scientific articles in the form of Question and Answer (QA) pairs. We propose two distinct approaches for generating QAs. The first approach involves selecting salient paragraphs, using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate questions, ranking these questions by the likelihood of obtaining meaningful answers, and subsequently generating answers. This method relies exclusively on the content of the articles. However, assessing an article`s novelty typically requires comparison with the existing literature. Therefore, our second approach leverages a Knowledge Graph (KG) for QA generation. We construct a KG by fine-tuning an Entity Relationship (ER) extraction model on scientific articles and using it to build the graph. We then employ a salient triplet extraction method to select the most pertinent ERs per article, utilizing metrics such as the centrality of entities based on a triplet TF-IDF-like measure. This measure assesses the saliency of a triplet based on its importance within the article compared to its prevalence in the literature. For evaluation, we generate QAs using both approaches and have them assessed by Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) through a set of predefined metrics to evaluate the quality of both questions and answers. Our evaluations demonstrate that the KG-based approach effectively captures the main ideas discussed in the articles.

While common, existing search systems often fail to effectively support TOT scenarios. Research on TOT retrieval is further constrained by the challenge of collecting queries, as current approaches rely heavily on community question-answering (CQA) websites, leading to labor-intensive evaluation and domain bias. To overcome these limitations, we introduce two methods for eliciting TOT queries—leveraging large language models (LLMs) and human participants—to facilitate simulated evaluations of TOT retrieval systems. Our LLM-based TOT user simulator generates synthetic TOT queries at scale, achieving high correlations with how CQA-based TOT queries rank TOT retrieval systems when tested in the Movie domain. Additionally, these synthetic queries exhibit high linguistic similarity to CQA-derived queries. For human-elicited queries, we developed an interface that uses visual stimuli to place participants in a TOT state, enabling the collection of natural queries. In the Movie domain, system rank correlation and linguistic similarity analyses confirm that human-elicited queries are both effective and closely resemble CQA-based queries. These approaches reduce reliance on CQA-based data collection while expanding coverage to underrepresented domains, such as Landmark and Person. LLM-elicited queries for the Movie, Landmark, and Person domains have been released as test queries in the TREC 2024 TOT track, with human-elicited queries scheduled for inclusion in the TREC 2025 TOT track.

To address the lack of ground-truth labels for table transformation, we propose a reinforced fine-tuning strategy that sequentially and jointly optimizes table transformation and symbolic reasoning within a single LLM call.

TabFormer is a scalable, one-time framework that leverages LLMs to transform one ore multiple tables in a single inference step, thereby enhancing both retrieval and reasoning for a wide range of tabular data tasks. Experimental evaluations on datasets such as WTQ, HiTab, MultiHiertt, and TabFact demonstrate significant gains in accuracy—improvements ranging from 4% to 17%—when applied to state-of-the-art methods, including GPT-4-based E5, Chain-of-Table, TableLlama, and others.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Diagram question answering (DQA) is a challenging task that requires models to combine with domain-specific knowledge and reason over the diagrams to answer questions. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently made notable strides in combining textual and visual information, emerging as a promising solution for addressing the DQA task. However, they still encounter challenges in deliberate multimodal reasoning over the fine-grained visual details of content-rich and knowledge-grounded diagrams. The tight interweaving of visual and textual reasoning for MLLMs is also susceptible to hallucinations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a \\\\textbf{Gl}ance-then-\\\\textbf{Fo}cus \\\\textbf{M}ultimodal \\\\textbf{R}easoning framework named \\\\textbf{GlFoMR} for DQA, which features a flexible architecture for comprehensive visual and text interaction. Firstly, the diagram is parsed into a hierarchical structure spanning different granularities including isolated single-object, object-group, and whole-diagram. Subsequently, the Glance-Plan and Focus-Reason stages collaborate to decouple the complex reasoning process. Glance-Plan first generates a preliminary plan by glancing at the multimodal context, specifying sub-goals related to knowledge extraction, visual perception, and visual reasoning. Based on these sub-goals, Focus-Reason further integrates domain-specific knowledge and visual details to enable more deliberate reasoning. The parsed multi-granularity diagram information is seamlessly incorporated into the corresponding sub-goal achievement process, enhancing the perception and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs for better DQA performance. Extensive experimental results on four DQA datasets demonstrate that GlFoMR achieves substantial improvements, showcasing its potential to advance the development of multimodal reasoning.',\n",

Recognizing this gap, we propose a novel framework FashionDPO, which fine-tunes the fashion outfit generation model using direct preference optimization.

Content Delivery Networks rely on edge computing to improve Quality of Experience at the client-side, and improve resource utilization at edge and cloud networks simultaneously by utilizing prefetching optimization techniques. Recently, we have witnessed a trend in shifting intelligence to edge networks by building video prefetchers that utilize deep reinforcement learning to make online prefetching decisions. Unfortunately, these methods often lack generalization to different workloads when dealing with long sequences, rendering them incapable of adapting to distribution shifts and various changes in users` requests which represent a non i.i.d distribution. In this work, we tackle video prefetching at edge networks as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process, and propose Techie, an intrinsically motivated policy-gradient reinforcement learning agent that differentiates intrinsic rewards from extrinsic rewards based on their availability to edge networks. Techie is adaptive to unseen user requests by prefetching aggressively to handle randomization in workloads, achieving 52.27% of prefetching accuracy and 34.34% of prefetching coverage. Our results show that Techie improves prefetching accuracy and coverage by at least 16.12% and 6.57%, respectively, compared to baseline approaches that utilize deep learning, deep reinforcement learning, or video popularity to build prefetching algorithms. Consequently, Techie minimizes end-to-end latency by at least 7.5% and reduces cache pollution with an improvement of at least 13.1% on unseen user requests compared to baselines.',\n",

However, these approaches often overlook the critical role of user characteristics, which are essential in real-world scenarios like conversational search and recommendation, where interactions must adapt to individual user traits such as personality, preferences, and goals. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive study using task-specific user personas to evaluate dialogue policy planning under diverse user behaviors. Our analysis, based on these user profiles, reveals significant shortcomings in existing approaches, underscoring the necessity for user-tailored dialogue policies. Building on these insights, we propose the User-Tailored Dialogue Policy Planning (UDP) framework, which integrates an Intrinsic User World Model to capture user traits and feedback. UDP operates in three stages: (1) User Persona Portraying, employing a diffusion model to dynamically infer user profiles; (2) User Feedback Anticipating, using a Brownian Bridge-inspired mechanism to predict user reactions; and (3) User-Tailored Policy Planning, synthesizing these elements to optimize response strategies. To enhance robustness, we introduce an active learning approach that prioritizes challenging user personas during training. Extensive experiments across benchmarks, including both collaborative and non-collaborative settings, demonstrate UDP’s effectiveness in learning user-specific dialogue strategies.

       "    'abstract': 'As a fundamental task in Information Retrieval and Computational Linguistics, sentence representation has profound implications for a wide range of practical applications such as text clustering, content analysis, question-answering systems, and web search. Recent advances in pre-trained language models (PLMs) have driven remarkable progress in this field, particularly through unsupervised embedding derivation methods centered on discriminative PLMs like BERT. However, due to time and computational constraints, few efforts have attempted to integrate unsupervised sentence representation with generative PLMs, which typically possess much larger parameter sizes. Given that state-of-the-art models in both academia and industry are predominantly based on generative architectures, there is a pressing need for an efficient unsupervised text representation framework tailored to decoder-only PLMs. To address this concern, we propose CSE-SFP, an innovative method that exploits the structural characteristics of generative models. Compared to existing strategies, CSE-SFP requires only a single forward pass to perform effective unsupervised contrastive learning. Rigorous experimentation demonstrates that CSE-SFP not only produces higher-quality embeddings but also significantly reduces both training time and memory consumption. Furthermore, we introduce two ratio metrics that jointly assess alignment and uniformity, thereby providing a more robust means for evaluating the semantic spatial properties of encoding models.

Existing fairness intervention algorithms incorporate constraints or regularizers to reduce discrimination which rely on the complete information. They cannot effectively handle common tabular data with missing values in both sensitive and non-sensitive attributes without imputation. In this paper, we propose a novel Transformer-based fairness-aware prediction model FATE that mitigates the bias introduced by missing values to achieve algorithmic fairness without imputation. FATE consists of two modules, i.e., an incomplete data encoding (IDE) module and a debiased representation learning (DRL) module. IDE designs an incomplete tabular data embedding strategy and a missingness-aware Transformer block to effectively learn the observed data distribution and the missing state information. DRL converts fairness into attention parity when the sensitive attributes are completely missing. It offers a debiased attention mechanism to normalize attention weights in the attention score calculation process. We theoretically prove that, the differences in attention scores can represent the demographic disparities among sensitive groups which in FATE are bounded by a constant, substantially minimizing the group discrimination. Extensive experiments on three public real-world datasets demonstrate that, FATE, with the competitive fairness, yields more than 22% accuracy gain, compared to the state of the arts.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Attribute-Specific Fashion Retrieval (ASFR) focuses on retrieving images based on fine-grained, attribute-specific criteria rather than naive global visual similarity, enabling more precise and interpretable search results. Existing ASFR methods ideally assume that all attribute semantics are in-domain distributions of the training datasets. However, realistic scenarios are generally more complex and naturally contain unseen attribute information, often resulting in ungeneralizable retrieval outcomes. In this paper, we take the first step to address the new and challenging open-world ASFR setting, which involves handling diverse and practical attributes instead of relying solely on predefined attribute sets in closed-world scenarios. Specifically, to comprehend unseen attributes, we propose a novel LLM-based Commonsense Knowledge Infusion (CoKi) framework that integrates commonsense knowledge as complementary context into attribute representations using a Large Language Model (LLM). By infusing such LLM-based commonsense knowledge through descriptive contexts, our method enables robust semantic enrichment and effective generalization to unseen attributes. Additionally, we introduce a modality-switchable prompt and an imputation mechanism to ensure model robustness across diverse input configurations by dynamically adapting to missing modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art in-domain retrieval performance but also significantly enhances adaptability to unseen attributes and cross-domain generalization, establishing a new benchmark for fine-grained fashion retrieval in open-world scenarios.

       "    'abstract': 'Graph convolutional networks have recently gained prominence in collaborative filtering (CF) for recommendations. However, we identify potential bottlenecks in two foundational components. First, the embedding layer leads to a latent space with limited capacity, overlooking locally observed but potentially valuable preference patterns. Also, the widely-used neighborhood aggregation is limited in its ability to leverage diverse preference patterns in a fine-grained manner. Building on spectral graph theory, we reveal that these limitations stem from graph filtering with a cut-off in the frequency spectrum and a restricted linear form. To address these issues, we introduce ChebyCF, a CF framework based on graph spectral filtering. Instead of a learned embedding, it takes a user`s raw interaction history to utilize the full spectrum of signals contained in it. Also, it adopts Chebyshev interpolation to effectively approximate a flexible non-linear graph filter, and further enhances it by using an additional ideal pass filter and degree-based normalization. Through extensive experiments, we verify that ChebyCF overcomes the aforementioned bottlenecks and achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks and reasonably fast inference.

This paper introduces a new task, continual origin tracing of LLM-generated text, which frames origin tracing in a continual learning or, more precisely, class-incremental learning manner, where new LLMs continuously emerge, and a model incrementally learns to identify new LLMs without forgetting old ones. A novel training-free method is further devised for the task, which continually extracts prototypes for emerging LLMs using a frozen pre-trained model, and conducts global and local prototype decorrelation to improve prototype matching, thus favoring more accurate tracing.

STAR-Rec addresses these challenges by: (1) employing preference-aware attention to capture both inherently similar item relationships and diverse preferences, (2) utilizing state-space modeling to efficiently process variable-length sequences with linear complexity, and (3) incorporating a mixture-of-experts component that adaptively routes different behavioral patterns to specialized experts, handling both focused category-specific browsing and diverse category exploration patterns.

While test collections have become an integral part of IR research, the process of data creation involves significant manual annotation effort, which often makes it very expensive and time-consuming. Consequently, test collections could become too small when the budget is limited, which may lead to unstable evaluations. As a cheaper alternative, recent studies have proposed the use of large language models (LLMs) to completely replace human assessors. However, while LLMs seem to somewhat correlate with human judgments, their predictions are not perfect and often show bias. Thus, a complete replacement with LLMs is argued to be too risky and not fully reliable.In this paper, we propose LLM-Assisted Relevance Assessments (LARA), an effective method to balance manual annotations with LLM annotations, which helps to build a rich and reliable test collection even under a low budget. We use the LLM`s predicted relevance probabilities to select the most profitable documents to manually annotate under a budget constraint. With theoretical reasoning, LARA effectively guides the human annotation process by actively learning to calibrate the LLM`s predicted relevance probabilities. Then, using the calibration model learned from the limited manual annotations, LARA debiases the LLM predictions to annotate the remaining non-assessed data. Empirical evaluations on TREC-7 Ad Hoc, TREC-8 Ad Hoc, TREC Robust 2004, and TREC-COVID datasets show that LARA outperforms alternative solutions under almost any budget constraint.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing information retrieval, with chatbots becoming an important source for answering user queries. As by their design, LLMs prioritize generating correct answers, the value of highly plausible yet incorrect answers (candidate answers) tends to be overlooked. However, such answers can still prove useful, for example, they can play a crucial role in tasks like Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) and QA Robustness Assessment (QARA). Existing QA datasets primarily focus on correct answers without explicit consideration of the plausibility of other candidate answers, limiting opportunity for more nuanced evaluations of models. To address this gap, we introduce PlausibleQA, a large-scale dataset comprising 10,000 questions and 100,000 candidate answers, each annotated with plausibility scores and justifications for their selection. Additionally, the dataset includes 900,000 justifications for pairwise comparisons between candidate answers, further refining plausibility assessments. We evaluate PlausibleQA through human assessments and empirical experiments, demonstrating its utility in MCQA and QARA analysis. Our findings show that plausibility-aware approaches are effective for MCQA distractor generation and QARA. We release PlausibleQA as a resource for advancing QA research and enhancing LLM performance in distinguishing plausible distractors from correct answers.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Recent advancements in knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) have shown promise, yet existing methods often fail to align with human reasoning patterns that involve continuous reflection and refinement. This paper proposes FD-PORT (flow-guided direct preference optimization for knowledge graph reasoning with trees), a novel approach that combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with flow-guided direct preference optimization (FDPO) for KGQA tasks. MCTS simulates human-like reasoning by systematically exploring multiple inference paths in knowledge graphs, while FDPO transforms the search feedback into fine-grained training signals through flow balance conditions. Unlike traditional methods focusing on end-to-end training or sequence-level preferences, FD-PORT establishes flow consistency between any states along the reasoning chain, enabling robust multi-hop reasoning that adapts to local decisions and long-range dependencies. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that FD-PORT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 50.6% improvements over GPT-4 on complex multi-hop reasoning tasks with a smaller open-source language model. The framework is advanced in maintaining diverse reasoning paths while ensuring answer quality, closely mirroring human problem-solving strategies.',\n",

The segmentation of semantic data, including image segmentation and word-level descriptions, often contain implicit relationships between entities that are frequently overlooked by existing methodologies, thus limiting the effectiveness of reasoning tasks. Therefore, we propose a novel completion inference method based on fine-grained semantic segmentation, which enhances reasoning capability by utilizing implicit relationships between entities. Primarily, we introduce the concept of Semantic Related Entity (SRE) and a novel SRE selection algorithm, which captures the semantic neighboring relationships of entities based on segmentation semantic similarity to fully exploit the semantic association information.  Subsequently, we propose a Multi-modal Related Entity Fusion Transformer (M-REFT) model to effectively utilize SREs from semantic modalities and neighbors from structural modality for completion inference. The M-REFT employs a hierarchical Transformer architecture to encode the fusion modality representation between each entity and its SREs, and then decode the triplet representation with the neighbor information to identify missing entities in incomplete triplets. We conducted extensive comparative experiments with several state-of-the-art models on three datasets, demonstrating the significant performance advantages of M-REFT. A series of ablation experiments and case studies further validate the rationality and necessity of the SRE concept and the SRE selection algorithm.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Sequential recommendation (SR) aims to infer users` future interests and suggest the next items for them. Most SR methods learn one single vector to represent a user`s recent interests, i.e., a user representation. Despite their great success, most of them do not explicitly consider the phenomenon of users` interest drift when learning user representations. Moreover, interest drift presents two critical challenges for these SR methods: (1) how to explore the potential distributions of the users` varying interest drift levels; and (2) how to capture the interest drift-aware collaborative knowledge among the users. In this paper, we delve into the issue of interest drift in SR and propose a novel and generic framework, i.e., Interest Drift-driven User Representation Learning (IDURL), to enhance SR methods to tackle the above two challenges. Specifically, our IDURL contains an interest drift quantization (IDQ) module to enable a quantitative measurement of the interest drift. Moreover, a drift representation generation module models the users` latent varying levels of interest drift, and an interest drift-guided representation disentanglement module optimizes the distributions of the interest drift levels under the guidance of IDQ. Furthermore, an interest drift-aware representation alignment module helps to capture the interest drift-aware collaborative knowledge among users. Finally, the users` overall interest representations are obtained to calculate the preference scores on the candidate items. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show the effectiveness of our IDURL. The source code of our IDURL is available at: https://github.com/xiaolLIN/IDURL.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Modern retrieval systems do not rely on a single ranking model to construct their rankings. Instead, they generally take a cascading approach where a sequence of ranking models are applied in multiple re-ranking stages. Thereby, they balance the quality of the top-K ranking with computational costs by limiting the number of documents each model re-ranks. However, the cascading approach is not the only way models can interact to form a retrieval system. We propose the concept of compound retrieval systems as a broader class of retrieval systems that apply multiple prediction models. This encapsulates cascading models but also allows other types of interactions than top-K re-ranking. In particular, we enable interactions with large language models (LLMs) which can provide relative relevance comparisons. We focus on the optimization of compound retrieval system design which uniquely involves learning where to apply the component models and how to aggregate their predictions into a final ranking. This work shows how our compound approach can combine the classic BM25 retrieval model with state-of-the-art (pairwise) LLM relevance predictions, while optimizing a given ranking metric and efficiency target. Our experimental results show optimized compound retrieval systems provide better trade-offs between effectiveness and efficiency than cascading approaches, even when applied in a self-supervised manner. With the introduction of compound retrieval systems, we hope to inspire the information retrieval field to more out-of-the-box thinking on how prediction models can interact to form rankings.',\n",

Our research explores how different query generation strategies affect news verification and whether the way people search influences the accuracy of their information evaluation. A mixed-methods approach was used, consisting of three parts: (1) an analysis of existing data to understand how search behaviour influences trust in fake news, (2) a simulation of query generation strategies using a Large Language Model (LLM) to assess the impact of different query formulations on search result quality, and (3) a user study to examine how `Boost` interventions in interface design can guide users to adopt more effective query strategies. The results show that search behaviour significantly affects trust in news, with successful searches involving multiple queries and yielding higher-quality results. Queries inspired by different parts of a news article produced search results of varying quality, and weak initial queries improved when reformulated using full SERP information. Although `Boost` interventions had limited impact, the study suggests that interface design encouraging users to thoroughly review search results can enhance query formulation. This study highlights the importance of query strategies in evaluating news and proposes that interface design can play a key role in promoting more effective search practices, serving as one component of a broader set of interventions to combat misinformation.',\n",

Our core idea is to enable LLMs to decide whether to take the action of ``ask`` or ``tell`` at each turn by self-reasoning, with the belief of the decisions enhanced by retrieving knowledge related to the user input. Thus, we propose the ask and retrieve knowledge framework (Ark), where LLMs think through what to retrieve, when to stop retrieving, and then take actions accordingly. Ark is used to produce the action paths for model training. To mitigate the collapse of models trained on synthetic data, we propose a progressive training strategy: self-reason learning by supervised fine-tuning on produced paths and knowledge alignment through direct preference optimization on doctor response. To evaluate the information gain brought by the ask action, we design a method to calculate the ask utility value (AUV) based on the expected value of perfect information (EVPI) theory. Although MedArk is trained using synthetic data from GPT-4o-mini, it highly outperforms GPT-4o and other medical LLMs in six aspects: helpfulness, hallucination, action selection, BERTScore, AUV, and asking correctness. MedArk also achieves SOTA results in the perfect information scenario, i.e., medical examinations. We release our code, data and models at https://github.com/Bolin97/MedArk.',\n",

Despite these advances, hallucinations and reasoning errors remain a significant barrier to their deployment in high-stakes settings. In this work, we observe that even the most prominent LLMs, such as OpenAI-o1, suffer from high rates of reasoning errors and hallucinations on tasks requiring commonsense reasoning over obscure, long-tail entities. To investigate this limitation, we present a new dataset for Commonsense reasoning over Long-Tail entities (CoLoTa), that consists of 3,300 queries from question answering and claim verification tasks and covers a diverse range of commonsense reasoning skills. We remark that CoLoTa can also serve as a Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) dataset since the support of knowledge required to answer its queries is present in the Wikidata knowledge graph. However, as opposed to existing KGQA benchmarks that merely focus on factoid questions, our CoLoTa queries also require commonsense reasoning. Our experiments with strong LLM-based KGQA methodologies indicate their severe inability to answer queries involving commonsense reasoning. Hence, we propose CoLoTa as a novel benchmark for assessing both (i) LLM commonsense reasoning capabilities and their robustness to hallucinations on long-tail entities and (ii) the commonsense reasoning capabilities of KGQA methods.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Recent studies have revealed a phenomenon known as source bias, where PLM-based retrievers assign higher relevance scores to LLM-generated content despite its semantic quality being comparable to human-written content. As LLMs rapidly advance and become more widely used, effectively counteracting source bias is crucial for the sustainable development of the information retrieval (IR) ecosystem. Existing methods primarily attempt to address source bias from the retriever side, adopting a ``passive defense`` approach that intervenes only after biased content has entered the retrieval pipeline. These solutions are limited by frequent retriever updates in industrial applications, high recurring costs, and their inability to address the root cause of source bias.In this paper, we propose a new perspective for mitigating source bias by actively aligning LLM outputs at the data generation stage. Specifically, we introduce LLM-SBM, a novel LLM alignment framework for source bias mitigation. First, we construct high-quality alignment datasets using an automatic preference data construction pipeline. This pipeline leverages LLMs to generate multiple rephrasings of content and employs a PLM-based retriever to assign corresponding specific preference values for each generated document, thereby forming preference pairs according to these preferences. Moreover, to fully utilize these scalar values of preference and enhance the efficiency of the alignment process, LLM-SBM incorporates these preference differences as weighting factors in the loss function during policy training. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and PLM-based retrievers demonstrate that LLMs aligned with LLM-SBM successfully reduce source bias while preserving their general capabilities.',\n",

In this work, we show that we can achieve a more efficient and effective list proposal with a multi-generator framework and provide empirical evidence on two public datasets and online A/B tests. More importantly, we verify that the effectiveness of a generator is closely related to how much it complements the views of other generators with sufficiently different rerankings, which derives the metric of list comprehensiveness. With this intuition, we design an automatic complementary generator-finding framework that learns a policy that simultaneously aligns the users` preferences and maximizes the list comprehensiveness metric.

Most existing methods generate multiple views from the same interaction sequence through stochastic data augmentation, aiming to align their representations in the embedding space. However, users typically have specific intents when purchasing items (e.g., buying clothes as gifts or cosmetics for beauty). Random data augmentation used in existing methods may introduce noise, disrupting the latent intent information implicit in the original interaction sequence. Moreover, using noisy augmented sequences in contrastive learning may mislead the model to focus on irrelevant features, distorting the embedding space and failing to capture users` true behavior patterns and intents. To address these issues, we propose Intent-aware Diffusion with contrastive learning for sequential Recommendation (InDiRec). The core idea is to generate item sequences aligned with users` purchasing intents, thus providing more reliable augmented views for contrastive learning. Specifically, InDiRec first performs intent clustering on sequence representations using K-means to build intent-guided signals. Next, it retrieves the intent representation of the target interaction sequence to guide a conditional diffusion model, generating positive views that share the same underlying intent. Finally, contrastive learning is applied to maximize representation consistency between these intent-aligned views and the original sequence. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that InDiRec achieves superior performance compared to existing baselines, learning more robust representations even under noisy and sparse data conditions.',\n",

To effectively cluster domains, we propose Causal Domain Clustering (CDC). CDC models domain transfer patterns within a large number of domains using two distinct effects: the Isolated Domain Affinity Matrix for modeling non-interactive domain transfers, and the Hybrid Domain Affinity Matrix for considering dynamic domain synergy or interference under joint training. To integrate these two transfer effects, we introduce causal discovery to calculate a cohesion-based coefficient that adaptively balances their contributions.

However, we identify two key limitations in existing methods regarding preferences for modality features: (L1) although preferences for modality features is an important aspect of users` preferences, existing methods only leverage neighbors with similar interactions and do not consider the neighbors who may have similar preferences for modality features while having different interactions; (L2) although modality features of a user and an item may have a complex geometric relationship in the latent space, existing methods overlook and face challenges in precisely capturing this relationship.

       "    'abstract': 'Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for the next Point-Of-Interest (POI) prediction task, leveraging their capabilities in semantic understanding of POI trajectories. However, previous LLM-based methods, which are superficially adapted to next POI prediction, largely overlook critical challenges associated with applying LLMs to this task. Specifically, LLMs encounter two critical challenges: (1) a lack of intrinsic understanding of numeric spatiotemporal data, which hinders accurate modeling of users` spatiotemporal distributions and preferences; and (2) an excessively large and unconstrained candidate POI space, which often results in random or irrelevant predictions. To address these issues, we propose a Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework for Next POI Prediction, named CoMaPOI. Through the close interaction of three specialized agents (Profiler, Forecaster, and Predictor), CoMaPOI collaboratively addresses the two critical challenges. The Profiler agent is responsible for converting numeric data into language descriptions, enhancing semantic understanding. The Forecaster agent focuses on dynamically constraining and refining the candidate POI space. The Predictor agent integrates this information to generate high-precision predictions. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (NYC, TKY, and CA) demonstrate that CoMaPOI achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving all metrics by 5% to 10% compared to SOTA baselines.

We propose a new paradigm; instead of representing a query as a vector, we use a small neural network that acts as a learned query-specific relevance function. This small neural network takes a document representation as input (in this work we use a single vector) and produces a scalar relevance score. To produce the small neural network we use a hypernetwork, a network that produces the weights of other networks, as our query encoder. We name this category of encoder models Hypencoders. Experiments on in-domain search tasks show that Hypencoders significantly outperform strong dense retrieval models and even surpass reranking models and retrieval models with an order of magnitude more parameters. To assess the extent of Hypencoders` capabilities, we evaluate on a set of hard retrieval tasks including tip-of-the-tongue and instruction-following retrieval tasks. On harder tasks, we find that the performance gap widens substantially compared to standard retrieval tasks.

       "    'abstract': 'A large item catalogue is a major challenge for deploying modern sequential recommender models, since it makes the memory footprint of the model large and increases inference latency. One promising approach to address this is RecJPQ, which replaces item embeddings with sub-item embeddings. However, slow inference remains problematic because finding the top highest-scored items usually requires scoring all items in the catalogue, which may not be feasible for large catalogues. By adapting dynamic pruning concepts from document retrieval, we propose the RecJPQPrune dynamic pruning algorithm to efficiently find the top highest-scored items without computing the scores of all items in the catalogue. Our RecJPQPrune algorithm is safe-up-to-rank K since it theoretically guarantees that no potentially high-scored item is excluded from the final top K recommendation list, thereby ensuring no impact on effectiveness. Our experiments on two large datasets and three recommendation models demonstrate the efficiency achievable using RecJPQPrune: for instance, on the Tmall dataset with 2.2M items, we can reduce the median model scoring time by 64× compared to the Transformer Default baseline, and 5.3× compared to a recent scoring approach called PQTopK. Overall, this paper demonstrates the effective and efficient inference of Transformer-based recommendation models at catalogue scales not previously reported in the literature. Indeed, our RecJPQPrune algorithm can score 2 million items in under 10 milliseconds without GPUs, and without relying on Approximate Nearest Neighbour (ANN) techniques.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Nearest neighbor search (NN search) plays a fundamental role in many disciplines. According to recent studies, graph-based search methods show superior performance over other types of methods. In order to accommodate the high dimensionality as well as the growing data-scale, the disk-based NN search in which the index graph and the full-precision vectors are kept in SSD has become a promising direction. This paper optimizes the disk-based NN search from three perspectives. Firstly, an eXtended Neighborhood Graph (XN-Graph) structure is proposed. In contrast to the existing index graphs, the out-edges of the graph neighborhood are collected from much wider coverage of the data space. It therefore reduces the number of hops during NN search, which in turn reduces the search latency. Additionally, a dataset partitioning method called Boundary-adaptive Balanced Partition is proposed to facilitate the graph construction in cases where the system cannot handle large datasets in a single round. Moreover, an efficient hybrid NN search method called In-Memory First Search is proposed. Compared to the existing methods, it considerably reduces the CPU idle times. With the support of XN-Graph, it shows 1.5-3 times lower search latency than SOTA methods. On billion-scale datasets, its QPS is still above 4000 when Recall@10 is as high as 0.9.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Recently, the personalization of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate content that aligns with individual user preferences has garnered widespread attention. Personalized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which retrieves relevant documents from the user`s history to reflect their preferences and enhance LLM generation, is one commonly used approach for personalization. However, existing personalized RAG methods do not consider that the histories of similar users can also assist in personalized generation for the current user, meaning that collaborative information between users can also benefit personalized generation. Inspired by the application of collaborative filtering in recommender systems, we propose a method called CFRAG, which adapts Collaborative Filtering to RAG for personalized text generation. However, this presents two challenges: (1) how to incorporate collaborative information without explicit user similarity labels? (2) how to retrieve documents that support personalized LLM generation? For Challenge 1, we use contrastive learning to train user embeddings to retrieve similar users and introduce collaborative information. For Challenge 2, we design a personalized retriever and reranker to retrieve the top-?? documents from these users` histories. We take into account the user`s preference during retrieval and reranking. Then we leverage feedback from the LLM to fine-tune the personalized retriever and reranker, enabling them to retrieve documents that meet the personalized generation needs of the LLM. Experimental results on the Language Model Personalization (LaMP) benchmark validate the effectiveness of CFRAG. Further analysis confirms the importance of incorporating collaborative information.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'In the digital era, users typically interact with diverse items across multiple domains (e.g., e-commerce, streaming platforms, and social networks), generating intricate heterogeneous interaction graphs. Leveraging multi-domain data can improve recommendation systems by enriching user insights and mitigating data sparsity in individual domains. However, integrating such multi-domain knowledge for cross-domain recommendation remains challenging due to inherent disparities in user behavior and item characteristics and the risk of negative transfer, where irrelevant or conflicting information from the source domains adversely impacts the target domain`s performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose HAGO, a novel framework with Heterogeneous Adaptive Graph coOrdinators, which dynamically integrates multi-domain graphs into a cohesive structure. HAGO adaptively adjusts the connections between coordinators and multi-domain graph nodes to enhance beneficial inter-domain interactions while alleviating negative transfer. Furthermore, we introduce a universal multi-domain graph pre-training strategy alongside HAGO to collaboratively learn high-quality node representations across domains. Being compatible with various graph-based models and pre-training techniques, HAGO demonstrates broad applicability and effectiveness.

       "    'abstract': 'Information Retrieval (IR) systems primarily rely on users` ability to translate their internal information needs into (text) queries. However, this translation process is often uncertain and cognitively demanding, leading to queries that incompletely or inaccurately represent users` true needs. This challenge is particularly acute for users with ill-defined information needs or physical impairments that limit traditional text input, where the gap between cognitive intent and query expression becomes even more pronounced. Recent neuroscientific studies have explored Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMIs) as a potential solution, aiming to bridge the gap between users` cognitive semantics and their search intentions. However, current approaches attempting to decode explicit text queries from brain signals have shown limited effectiveness in learning robust brain-to-text representations, often failing to capture the nuanced semantic information present in brain patterns. To address these limitations, we propose BPR -Brain Passage Retrieval, a novel framework that eliminates the need for intermediate query translation by enabling direct retrieval of relevant passages from users` brain signals. Our approach leverages dense retrieval architectures to map EEG signals and text passages into a shared semantic space. Through comprehensive experiments on the ZuCo dataset, we demonstrate that BPR achieves up to 8.81% improvement in precision@5 over existing EEG-to-text baselines, while maintaining effectiveness across 30 participants. Our ablation studies reveal the critical role of hard negative sampling and specialised brain encoders in achieving robust cross-modal alignment. These results establish the viability of direct brain-to-passage retrieval and provide a foundation for developing more natural interfaces between users` cognitive states and IR systems.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Generative information retrieval (GenIR) is a promising neural retrieval paradigm that formulates document retrieval as a document identifier (docid) generation task, allowing for end-to-end optimization toward a unified global retrieval objective. However, existing GenIR models suffer from token-level misalignment, where models trained to predict the next token often fail to capture document-level relevance effectively. While reinforcement learning-based methods, such as reinforcement learning from relevance feedback (RLRF), aim to address this misalignment through reward modeling, they introduce significant complexity, requiring the optimization of an auxiliary reward function followed by reinforcement fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and often unstable. To address these challenges, we propose direct document relevance optimization (DDRO), which aligns token-level docid generation with document-level relevance estimation through direct optimization via pairwise ranking, eliminating the need for explicit reward modeling and reinforcement learning. Experimental results on benchmark datasets, including MS MARCO document and Natural Questions, show that DDRO outperforms reinforcement learning-based methods, achieving a 7.4% improvement in MRR@10 for MS MARCO and a 19.9% improvement for Natural Questions. These findings highlight DDRO’s potential to enhance retrieval effectiveness with a simplified optimization approach. By framing alignment as a direct optimization problem, DDRO simplifies the ranking optimization pipeline of GenIR models while offering a viable alternative to reinforcement learning-based methods',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'This paper concerns corpus poisoning attacks in dense information retrieval, where an adversary attempts to compromise the ranking performance of a search algorithm by injecting a small number of maliciously generated documents into the corpus. Our work addresses two limitations in the current literature. First, attacks that perform adversarial gradient-based word substitution search do so in the discrete lexical space, while retrieval itself happens in the continuous embedding space. We thus propose an optimization method that operates in the embedding space directly. Specifically, we train a perturbation model with the objective of maintaining the geometric distance between the original and adversarial document embeddings, while also maximizing the token-level dissimilarity between the original and adversarial documents. Second, it is common for related work to have a strong assumption that the adversary has prior knowledge about the queries. In this paper, we focus on a more challenging variant of the problem where the adversary assumes no prior knowledge about the query distribution (hence, unsupervised). Our core contribution is an adversarial corpus attack that is fast and effective. We present comprehensive experimental results on both in- and out-of-domain datasets,  focusing on two related tasks: a top-1 attack and a corpus poisoning attack. We consider attacks under both a white-box and a black-box setting. Notably, our method can generate successful adversarial examples in under two minutes per target document; four times faster compared to the fastest gradient-based word substitution methods in the literature with the same hardware. Furthermore, our adversarial generation method generates text that is more likely to occur under the distribution of natural text (low perplexity), and is therefore more difficult to detect.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Interactions between entities are often time-dependent in real-world systems such as e-commerce, social networks, streaming platforms, finance, and healthcare, and are best modeled as temporal interaction graphs. The temporal dimension plays a crucial role in modern recommendation systems, which rely on future link predictions. Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNN) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in future link prediction tasks for temporal interaction graphs. However, these models often require substantial training data unavailable in real-world settings. A potential solution to data scarcity is model pre-training on semantically related datasets. Unfortunately, transferring the TGNN model from one dataset to another is not trivial, as it contains node-specific memory modules vital for performance, resulting in them being inherently non-transferable. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel transfer method that effectively utilizes common attributes between source and target datasets by decoupling graph nodes and corresponding attributes via bipartite encoding. This decoupling facilitates the transfer of memories and other inductive biases from source datasets to a target dataset. We evaluate the proposed transfer technique on real-world datasets and establish that it improves the performance of TGNN on the target dataset by 56% compared to the no-transfer methods and 36% over the state-of-the-art baselines in data-scarce settings.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Document chunking fundamentally impacts Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by determining how source materials are segmented before indexing. Despite evidence that Large Language Models (LLMs) are sensitive to the layout and structure of retrieved data, there is currently no framework to analyze the impact of different chunking methods. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology that defines essential characteristics of the chunking process at three levels: intrinsic passage properties, extrinsic passage properties, and passages-document coherence. We propose HOPE (Holistic Passage Evaluation), a domain-agnostic, automatic evaluation metric that quantifies and aggregates these characteristics. Our empirical evaluations across seven domains demonstrate that the HOPE metric correlates significantly (p > 0.13) with various RAG performance indicators, revealing contrasts between the importance of extrinsic and intrinsic properties of passages. Semantic independence between passages proves essential for system performance with a performance gain of up to 56.2% in factual correctness and 21.1% in answer correctness. On the contrary, traditional assumptions about maintaining concept unity within passages show minimal impact. These findings provide actionable insights for optimizing chunking strategies, thus improving RAG system design to produce more factually correct responses.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The essence of sequential recommender systems (RecSys) lies in understanding how users make decisions. Most existing approaches frame the task as sequential prediction based on users` historical purchase records. Although effective in capturing users` natural preferences, this formulation falls short in accurately modeling actual recommendation scenarios, particularly in accounting for how unsuccessful recommendations influence future purchases. Furthermore, the impact of the RecSys itself on users` decisions has not been appropriately isolated and quantitatively analyzed. To address these challenges, we propose a novel formulation of sequential recommendation, called Causal Sequential Recommendation. Instead of merely predicting the next item in a sequence, CSRec distinguishes between a user`s natural preference and their actual purchasing decision. It predicts both aspects within a sequential context and traces how current decisions are formed and causally influenced by various factors. Applying such a causal framework can isolate the impact of recommender systems on user decisions, thereby opening new avenues for evaluation and design. This includes assessing how different strategies influence users` trust in the system and determining the optimal recommender system to maximize advertising benefits. CSRec can be seamlessly integrated into existing next-prediction-based methodologies. Experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed implementation significantly improves upon state-of-the-art baselines.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Generative recommendation aims to learn the underlying generative process over the entire item set to produce recommendations for users. Although it leverages non-linear probabilistic models to surpass the limited modeling capacity of linear factor models, it is often constrained by a trade-off between representation ability and tractability. With the rise of a new generation of generative methods based on pre-trained language models (LMs), incorporating LMs into general recommendation with implicit feedback has gained considerable attention. However, adapting them to generative recommendation remains challenging. The core reason lies in the mismatch between the input-output formats and semantics of generative models and LMs, making it challenging to achieve optimal alignment in the feature space. This work addresses this issue by proposing a model-agnostic generative recommendation framework called DMRec, which introduces a probabilistic meta-network to bridge the outputs of LMs with user interactions, thereby enabling an equivalent probabilistic modeling process. Subsequently, we design three cross-space distribution matching processes aimed at maximizing shared information while preserving the unique semantics of each space and filtering out irrelevant information.   We apply DMRec to three different types of generative recommendation methods and conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that DMRec can effectively enhance the recommendation performance of these generative models, and it shows significant advantages over mainstream LM-enhanced recommendation methods.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Text-to-Video Retrieval (TVR) aims to retrieve relevant videos based on textual queries. However, as video content evolves continuously, adapting TVR systems to new data remains a critical yet under-explored challenge. In this paper, we introduce the first benchmark for Continual Text-to-Video Retrieval (CTVR) to address the limitations of existing approaches. Current Pre-Trained Model (PTM)-based TVR methods struggle with maintaining model plasticity when adapting to new tasks, while existing Continual Learning (CL) methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, leading to semantic misalignment between historical queries and stored video features. To address these two challenges, we propose FrameFusionMoE, a novel CTVR framework that comprises two key components: (1) the Frame Fusion Adapter (FFA), which captures temporal video dynamics while preserving model plasticity, and (2) the Task-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (TAME), which ensures consistent semantic alignment between queries across tasks and the stored video features. Thus, FrameFusionMoE enables effective adaptation to new video content while preserving historical text-video relevance to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We comprehensively evaluate FrameFusionMoE on two benchmark datasets under various task settings. Results demonstrate that FrameFusionMoE outperforms existing CL and TVR methods, achieving superior retrieval performance with minimal degradation on earlier tasks when handling continuous video streams.

       "    'abstract': 'Recently, recommendation models based on collaborative filtering have increasingly leveraged not only primary user-item interactions but also auxiliary information such as implicit relational structures (e.g., user-user or item-item graphs) and multimodal content (e.g., images and textual descriptions) to enhance recommendation performance. A key challenge in this context lies in effectively integrating auxiliary features derived from semantic structures or modality representations into user-item modeling, in a way that enhance performance without incurring detrimental effects. Furthermore, since these features often originate from heterogeneous semantic or modal spaces, they may include redundant or task-irrelevant information that can hinder the learning process. To address these issues, we propose the Collaborative Diffusion Models for Recommendation (CoDMR). CoDMR employs diffusion models in latent feature spaces to filter out task-irrelevant noise embedded in auxiliary features. It introduces task-relevant collaborative signals as conditional guidance during the denoising process, facilitating the generation of auxiliary representations aligned with the recommendation task. These refined features are then incorporated into user-item interaction modeling, resulting in enhanced representations for both users and items.

However, compared to the widely researched pedestrian and vehicle ReID, Ship ReID has received much less attention, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale and high-quality ship ReID datasets available for public access. Moreover, several unique challenges make ship ReID particularly difficult: ships are large objects that are hard to capture fully, and the visible area of ships vary significantly due to changes in cargo loading or water surface conditions.These challenges make it difficult to achieve ideal results by directly applying existing ReID methods. To address these challenges, in this paper, we introduce \\\\textit{ShipReID-2400}, a dataset for ship ReID compiled from a real-world intelligent waterway traffic monitoring system.

Recent advancements in next POI recommendation have further leveraged spatio-temporal graphs to uncover the transitional and geographical regularities. However, these methods are usually vulnerable due to the presence of data biases in real-life scenarios, which may mislead the model to disproportionately favoring certain POIs. To this end, this paper proposes a new graph debiasing paradigm for POI recommendation, which disentangles causal and bias knowledge within spatio-temporal graphs, allowing for not only the mitigation of bias issues, but also the utilization of causal information from spatial and temporal perspectives. Specifically, to facilitate graph debiasing at its topological level, an adaptive edge mask generator is first designed to explicitly decompose an entangled graph into causal and bias subgraphs. We encourage the stable relationships between the causal subgraph and the prediction, while the bias subgraph targets at the skewed bias distribution. We further enhance the independence between such two parts by employing a causal-bias disagreement regularization to encourage their distribution in separate semantic spaces. In addition, an inter-view contrastive learning module is also applied to maintain the relation discriminability of transitional and geographical representations. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model on recommendation performance, as well as its robustness against data bias.',\n",

However, constrained by the limited context length of LLMs, existing approaches have to truncate item history in the prompt, focusing only on recent interactions and sacrificing the ability to model long-term history. To enable LLMs to model long histories, we pursue a concise embedding representation for items and sessions. In the LLM embedding space, we construct an item`s embedding by aggregating its textual token embeddings; similarly, we construct a session`s embedding by aggregating its item embeddings. While efficient, this way poses two challenges since it ignores the temporal significance of user interactions and LLMs do not natively interpret our custom embeddings. To overcome these, we propose PatchRec, a multi-grained patch training method consisting of two stages: (1) Patch Pre-training, which familiarizes LLMs with aggregated embeddings -- patches, and (2) Patch Fine-tuning, which enables LLMs to capture time-aware significance in interaction history. Extensive experiments show that PatchRec effectively models longer behavior histories with improved efficiency.

The former means existing CDSR methods severely rely on users who own interactions on all domains to learn cross-domain item relationships, compromising the practicability. The latter refers to the difficulties in learning the complex transition patterns from the mixed behavior sequences. With powerful representation and reasoning abilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) are promising to address these two problems by bridging the items and capturing the user`s preferences from a semantic view.

A classic GCL-based method typically uses data augmentation during graph convolution to generates more contrastive views, and performs contrast on these new views to obtain rich self-supervised signals. Despite this paradigm is effective, the reasons behind the performance gains remain a mystery. In this paper, we first reveal via theoretical derivation that the gradient descent process of the CL objective is formally equivalent to graph convolution, which implies that CL objective inherently supports neighborhood aggregation on interaction graphs. We further substantiate this capability through experimental validation and identify common misconceptions in the selection of positive samples in previous methods, which limit the potential of CL objective. Based on this discovery, we propose the Light Contrastive Collaborative Filtering (LightCCF) method, which introduces a novel neighborhood aggregation objective to bring users closer to all interacted items while pushing them away from other positive pairs, thus achieving high-quality neighborhood aggregation with very low time complexity.

       "    'abstract': 'The geolocation of social users is crucial for understanding user behavior, optimizing advertisement placement, and enhancing public safety. However, existing methods tend to show some deficiencies when handling sparse datasets and may not fully capture the natural clustering characteristics of user locations, thereby resulting in inadequate geolocation accuracy. This paper proposes a novel social user geolocation method (MILGCN) that innovatively integrates Mean Shift Clustering, Incremental Learning, and Graph Convolutional Networks. Specifically, Mean Shift performs fine-grained clustering of user locations based on density peak characteristics, ensuring that geographically close users are grouped into the same cluster. Introducing an incremental learning mechanism into graph convolutional networks enables MILGCN to have progressive learning ability. As a result, the problem of incomplete feature extraction from sparse data is alleviated, resulting in more comprehensive user features and improved geolocation accuracy. Extensive experiments proved that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on the real Twitter datasets, demonstrating a substantial improvement in geolocation performance.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The sequential recommendation system utilizes historical user interactions to predict preferences. Effectively integrating diverse user behavior patterns with rich multimodal information of items to enhance the accuracy of sequential recommendations is an emerging and challenging research direction. This paper focuses on the problem of multi-modal multi-behavior sequential recommendation, aiming to address the following challenges: (1) the lack of effective characterization of modal preferences across different behaviors, as user attention to different item modalities varies depending on the behavior; (2) the difficulty of effectively mitigating implicit noise in user behavior, such as unintended actions like accidental clicks; (3) the inability to handle modality noise in multi-modal representations, which further impacts the accurate modeling of user preferences. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Multi-Behavior Sequential Recommendation model (M3BSR). This model first removes noise in multi-modal representations using a Conditional Diffusion Modality Denoising Layer. Subsequently, it utilizes deep behavioral information to guide the denoising of shallow behavioral data, thereby alleviating the impact of noise in implicit feedback through Conditional Diffusion Behavior Denoising. Finally, by introducing a Multi-Expert Interest Extraction Layer, M3BSR explicitly models the common and specific interests across behaviors and modalities to enhance recommendation performance. Experimental results indicate that M3BSR significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.',\n",

Current video recommendation models primarily treat each video as a whole, overlooking the dynamic nature of user preferences with specific video segments. In contrast, our research focuses on segment-level user interest modeling, which is crucial for understanding how users` preferences evolve during video browsing. To capture users` dynamic segment interests, we propose an innovative model that integrates a hybrid representation module, a multi-modal user-video encoder, and a segment interest decoder. Our model addresses the challenges of capturing dynamic interest patterns, missing segment-level labels, and fusing different modalities, achieving precise segment-level interest prediction. We present two downstream tasks to evaluate the effectiveness of our segment interest modeling approach: video-skip prediction and short video recommendation. Our experiments on real-world short video datasets with diverse modalities show promising results on both tasks. It demonstrates that segment-level interest modeling brings a deep understanding of user engagement and enhances video recommendations. We also release a unique dataset that includes segment-level video data and diverse user behaviors, enabling further research in segment-level interest modeling.

But how do these agents perform in complex high-stakes domains, where domain expertise is essential and mistakes carry substantial risk? This paper investigates the effectiveness of LLM-advisors in the finance domain, focusing on three distinct challenges: (1) eliciting user preferences when users themselves may be unsure of their needs, (2) providing personalized guidance for diverse investment preferences, and (3) leveraging advisor personality to build relationships and foster trust. Via a lab-based user study with 64 participants, we show that LLM-advisors often match human advisor performance when eliciting preferences, although they can struggle to resolve conflicting user needs. When providing personalized advice, the LLM was able to positively influence user behavior, but demonstrated clear failure modes. Our results show that accurate preference elicitation is key, otherwise, the LLM-advisor has little impact, or can even direct the investor toward unsuitable assets. More worryingly, users appear insensitive to the quality of advice being given, or worse these can have an inverse relationship. Indeed, users reported a preference for and increased satisfaction as well as emotional trust with LLMs adopting an extroverted persona, even though those agents provided worse advice.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of applications, e.g., medical question-answering, mathematical sciences, and code generation. However, they also exhibit inherent limitations, such as outdated knowledge and susceptibility to hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm to address these issues, but it also introduces new vulnerabilities. Recent efforts have focused on the security of RAG-based LLMs, yet existing attack methods face three critical challenges: (1) their effectiveness declines sharply when only a limited number of poisoned texts can be injected into the knowledge database, (2) they lack sufficient stealth, as the attacks are often detectable by anomaly detection systems, which compromises their effectiveness, and (3) they rely on heuristic approaches to generate poisoned texts, lacking formal optimization frameworks and theoretic guarantees, which limits their effectiveness and applicability. To address these issues, we propose coordinated Prompt-RAG attack (PR-attack), a novel optimization-driven attack that introduces a small number of poisoned texts into the knowledge database while embedding a backdoor trigger within the prompt. When activated, the trigger causes the LLM to generate pre-designed responses to targeted queries, while maintaining normal behavior in other contexts. This ensures both high effectiveness and stealth. We formulate the attack generation process as a bilevel optimization problem leveraging a principled optimization framework to develop optimal poisoned texts and triggers. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PR-Attack, achieving a high attack success rate even with a limited number of poisoned texts and significantly improved stealth compared to existing methods. These results highlight the potential risks posed by PR-Attack and emphasize the importance of securing RAG-based LLMs against such threats.',\n",

Although the traditional methods have achieved significant advancements, they predominantly rely on modeling basic pairwise relationships between nodes, limiting their ability to capture the intricate structures and interactions present in heterogeneous graphs. Recent studies have begun incorporating simplicial complexes, which effectively encode higher-order interactions, into the Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework. However, these GNN-based approaches are computationally intensive due to the substantial parameter training involved. To address these challenges, we propose HGSketch, a practical heterogeneous graph embedding algorithm that balances performance and temporal efficiency without the powerful workhorses. By leveraging the Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) technique, HGSketch efficiently captures higher-order information from simplicial complexes locally and globally without the need for parameter learning. The extensive experiment results display that HGSketch achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art learning-based methods, while significantly reducing runtime by a factor of up to 1223.86; also, HGSketch generally outperforms the state-of-the-art LSH-based methods.

Given the fundamental gap between the mechanism of LLMs and the requirement of RS, researchers have focused on fine-tuning LLMs with recommendation-specific data to enhance their performance. Language Modeling Loss (LML),  originally designed for language generation tasks, is commonly adopted. However, we identify two critical limitations of LML: 1) it exhibits significant divergence from the recommendation objective; 2) it erroneously treats all fictitious item descriptions as negative samples, introducing misleading training signals.To address these limitations, we propose a novel \\\\textbf{Masked Softmax Loss (MSL)} tailored for fine-tuning LLMs on recommendation. MSL improves LML by identifying and masking invalid tokens that could lead to fictitious item descriptions during loss computation. This strategy can effectively avoid the interference from erroneous negative signals and ensure well alignment with the recommendation objective supported by theoretical guarantees. During implementation, we identify a potential challenge related to gradient vanishing of MSL. To overcome this, we further introduce the temperature coefficient and propose an \\\\textbf{Adaptive Temperature Strategy (ATS)} that adaptively adjusts the temperature without requiring extensive hyperparameter tuning.

       "    'abstract': 'New-items play a crucial role in recommender systems (RSs) for delivering fresh and engaging user experiences. However, traditional methods struggle to effectively recommend new-items due to their short exposure time and limited interaction records, especially in dynamic recommender systems (DRSs) where new-items get continuously introduced and users` preferences evolve over time. This leads to significant unfairness towards new-items, which could accumulate over the successive model updates, ultimately compromising the stability of the entire system. Therefore, we propose FairAgent, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based new-item fairness enhancement framework specifically designed for DRSs. It leverages knowledge distillation to extract collaborative signals from traditional models, retaining strong recommendation capabilities for old-items. In addition, FairAgent introduces a novel reward mechanism for recommendation tailored to the characteristics of DRSs, which consists of three components: 1) a new-item exploration reward to promote the exposure of dynamically introduced new-items, 2) a fairness reward to adapt to users` personalized fairness requirements for new-items, and 3) an accuracy reward which leverages users` dynamic feedback to enhance recommendation accuracy. Extensive experiments on three public datasets and backbone models demonstrate the superior performance of FairAgent. The results present that FairAgent can effectively boost new-item exposure, achieve personalized new-item fairness, while maintaining high recommendation accuracy.',\n",

Recent advances in CDR have demonstrated the effectiveness of the unified distribution paradigm, which leverages shared distributions to transfer knowledge across domains and employs domain-specific adapters for targeted recommendations. While this well-designed paradigm shows promising performance, existing methods require extra supervision signals (e.g. contrastive learning on domain-masked embeddings) to maintain unified distributions across domains, leading to an inherent trade-off between unified objectives and domain-specific preference modeling. To address these limitations, we propose CD-CDR (Conditional Diffusion-CDR), a novel approach that leverages a shared conditional diffusion model to learn unified item distributions and facilitate knowledge transfer across domains. The key insight is to utilize the powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models to learn a shared distribution while naturally incorporating domain-specific characteristics through conditional generation. This design enables CD-CDR to replace traditional adapters with generation conditions as an integral part of the distribution model, thereby eliminating extra supervision signals and fundamentally resolving the trade-off between unified and domain-specific objectives. Extensive experiments on six domain pairs from two real-world datasets demonstrate that CD-CDR significantly outperforms existing methods for both normal and cold-start settings.

       "    'abstract': 'Ensuring fair recommendations for users with different sensitive attributes is essential for building trustworthy recommender systems. A significant challenge in achieving this in the real world is that some users are unwilling to disclose their sensitive attributes, limiting the applicability of traditional approaches. Recent efforts have attempted to address this challenge by reconstructing sensitive attributes based on the observed data. However, the observed data often does not represent an unbiased sample of the true distribution, rendering the reconstructed results unreliable. Moreover, it is difficult to select a debiasing method to achieve unbiased reconstruction, due to lacking sufficient prior knowledge about the bias. This motivates us to develop new fairness approaches. This work proposes a new method, Multiple Prior-Guided Robust Optimization (MPR), to achieve fair recommendations under biased observations of sensitive attributes, without requiring real sensitive attribute distribution. MPR begins by estimating various potential distributions of sensitive attributes using multiple randomly set priors, and then ensures fairness by minimizing the worst-case unfairness across all estimations. Thus, MPR can ensure fairness optimization under the real distribution approximately once one of the estimates approaches the true distribution. Both theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrate that MPR effectively ensures fairness in recommender systems when sensitive attribute observations are limited and biased.

       "    'abstract': 'Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become the preferred models for node classification in graph data due to their robust capabilities in integrating graph structures and attributes. However, these models heavily depend on a substantial amount of high-quality labeled data for training, which is often costly to obtain. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), a promising approach is to utilize their exceptional zero-shot capabilities and extensive knowledge for node labeling. Despite encouraging results, this approach either requires numerous queries to LLMs or suffers from reduced performance due to noisy labels generated by LLMs. To address these challenges, we introduce \\\\textbf{Locle}, an active self-training framework that does \\\\underline{\\\\textbf{L}}abel-free n\\\\underline{\\\\textbf{O}}de \\\\underline{\\\\textbf{C}}lassification with \\\\underline{\\\\textbf{L}}LMs cost-\\\\underline{\\\\textbf{E}}ffectively. Locle iteratively identifies small sets of \"critical\" samples using GNNs and extracts informative pseudo-labels for them with both LLMs and GNNs, serving as additional supervision signals to enhance model training. Specifically, Locle comprises three key components: (i) an effective active node selection strategy for initial annotations; (ii) a careful sample selection scheme to identify \"critical\" nodes based on label disharmonicity and entropy; and (iii) a label refinement module that combines LLMs and GNNs with a rewired topology. Extensive experiments on five benchmark text-attributed graph datasets demonstrate that Locle significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods under the same query budget to LLMs in terms of label-free node classification. Notably, on the DBLP dataset with 14.3k nodes, Locle achieves an 8.08\\\\% improvement in accuracy over the state-of-the-art at a cost of less than one cent.

       "    'abstract': 'Implicit feedback has become the primary source of training data for modern recommender systems due to its abundance and ease of collection. However, the inherent noise in implicit feedback poses significant challenges to model training. Existing denoising approaches either completely remove suspected noisy interactions (re-sampling) or uniformly adjust their importance (re-weighting). Such coarse-grained treatments fail to capture the complex nature of noise in real-world scenarios, where different aspects of an interaction may have varying noise levels.In this paper, we propose a novel perspective on fine-grained denoising. Our key insight is that noisy interactions often result from simple, impulsive decisions triggered by surface-level aspects and thus require less information to represent, while genuine preferences involve more complex considerations of aspects that need richer representations. Based on this insight, we propose DAR, a dimension-adaptive recommendation framework that dynamically adjusts each interaction`s representation dimension to achieve fine-grained denoising control (re-scaling). Grounded on the Information Bottleneck theory, we establish that this dimension-adaptive approach provides a principled solution for preserving useful signals while limiting noise propagation. DAR implements this theoretical insight through three key components: (1) multi-granular noise estimation that considers interaction-level, user-level, and item-level signals, (2) dimension adaptation that determines appropriate representation dimensions based on estimated noise levels, and (3) temporal smoothing that ensures stable training. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DAR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art denoising methods, while providing interpretable insights about interaction noise.

       "    'abstract': 'Pre-trained language models based on transformer networks are highly effective for document re-ranking in ad-hoc search. Among these, cross-encoders stand out for their effectiveness, as they process query-document pairs through the entire transformer network to compute ranking scores. However, this traversal is computationally expensive. To address this, prior work has explored early-exit strategies, enabling the model to terminate the traversal of query-document pairs. These techniques rely on learned classifiers, placed after each transformer block, that decide if a query-document pair can be dropped. Diverging from previous approaches, we propose Similarity-based Early Exit (SEE), a novel—non-learned—strategy that exploits the similarities between query and document token embeddings to early-terminate the inference of documents that will most likely be non-relevant to the query. Even though SEE can be used after every transformer block, we show that the best advantage is achieved when applied before the first transformer block, thus saving most of the inference cost for the query-document pairs. Reproducible experiments on 17 public datasets covering in-domain and out-of-domain evaluation show that SEE can be effectively applied to four different cross-encoders, achieving speedups of up to 3.5× with a limited loss in ranking effectiveness.',\n",

Most evaluations rely on deterministic metrics that depend on string or n-gram matching, while the reliability of large language model-based evaluations for long-form answers remains relatively unexplored. We address this gap by conducting an in-depth study of long-form answer evaluation with the following research questions: (i) To what extent do existing automatic evaluation metrics serve as a substitute for human evaluations? (ii) What are the limitations of existing evaluation metrics compared to human evaluations? (iii) How can the effectiveness and robustness of existing evaluation methods be improved? We collect 5,236 factoid and non-factoid long-form answers generated by different large language models and conduct a human evaluation on 2,079 of them, focusing on correctness and informativeness. Subsequently, we investigated the performance of automatic evaluation metrics by evaluating these answers, analyzing the consistency between these metrics and human evaluations. We find that the style, length of the answers, and the category of questions can bias the automatic evaluation metrics. However, fine-grained evaluation helps mitigate this issue on some metrics.

       "    'abstract': 'Sequential recommender systems (SRSs) excel in capturing users` dynamic interests, thus playing a key role in various industrial applications. The popularity of SRSs has also driven emerging research on their security aspects, where data poisoning attack for targeted item promotion is a typical example. Existing attack mechanisms primarily focus on increasing the ranks of target items in the recommendation list by injecting carefully crafted interactions (i.e., poisoning sequences), which comes at the cost of demoting users` real preferences. Consequently, noticeable recommendation accuracy drops are observed, restricting the stealthiness of the attack. Additionally, the generated poisoning sequences are prone to substantial repetition of target items, which is a result of the unitary objective of boosting their overall exposure and lack of effective diversity regularizations. Such homogeneity not only compromises the authenticity of these sequences, but also limits the attack effectiveness, as it ignores the opportunity to establish sequential dependencies between the target and many more items in the SRS. To address the issues outlined, we propose a Diversity-aware Dual-promotion Sequential Poisoning attack method named DDSP for SRSs. Specifically, by theoretically revealing the conflict between recommendation and existing attack objectives, we design a revamped attack objective that promotes the target item while maintaining the relevance of preferred items in a user`s ranking list. We further develop a diversity-aware, auto-regressive poisoning sequence generator, where a re-ranking method is in place to sequentially pick the optimal items by integrating diversity constraints. By attacking two representative SRSs on three real-world datasets, comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that DDSP outperforms state-of-the-art attack methods in attack effectiveness. Moreover, DDSP achieves the strongest stealthiness with its lowest impact on recommendation accuracy.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is a critical task in online advertising and recommender systems, relying on effective modeling of feature interactions. Explicit interactions capture predefined relationships, such as inner products, but often suffer from data sparsity, while implicit interactions excel at learning complex patterns through non-linear transformations but lack inductive biases for efficient low-order modeling. Existing two-stream architectures integrate these paradigms but face challenges such as limited information sharing, gradient imbalance, and difficulty preserving low-order signals in sparse CTR data.We propose a novel framework, Dynamic Low-Order-Aware Fusion (DLF), which addresses these limitations through two key components: a Residual-Aware Low-Order Interaction Network (RLI) and a Network-Aware Attention Fusion Module (NAF). RLI explicitly preserves low-order signals while mitigating redundancy from residual connections, and NAF dynamically integrates explicit and implicit representations at each layer, enhancing information sharing and alleviating gradient imbalance. Together, these innovations balance low-order and high-order interactions, improving model expressiveness.Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that DLF achieves state-of-the-art performance in CTR prediction, addressing key limitations of existing models.

       "    'abstract': 'In the field of multi-document summarization (MDS), transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable success, yet they suffer an input length limitation. Current methods apply truncation after the retrieval process to fit the context length; however, they heavily depend on manually well-crafted queries, which are impractical to create for each document set for MDS. Additionally, these methods retrieve information at a coarse granularity, leading to the inclusion of irrelevant content. To address these issues, we propose a novel retrieval-based framework that integrates query selection and document ranking and shortening into a unified process. Our approach identifies the most salient elementary discourse units (EDUs) from input documents and utilizes them as latent queries. These queries guide the document ranking by calculating relevance scores. Instead of traditional truncation, our approach filters out irrelevant EDUs to fit the context length, ensuring that only critical information is preserved for summarization. We evaluate our framework on multiple MDS datasets, demonstrating consistent improvements in ROUGE metrics while confirming its scalability and flexibility across diverse model architectures. Additionally, we validate its effectiveness through an in-depth analysis, emphasizing its ability to dynamically select appropriate queries and accurately rank documents based on their relevance scores. These results demonstrate that our framework effectively addresses context-length constraints, establishing it as a robust and reliable solution for MDS.',\n",

Recently, a new approach known as joint advertising has emerged, which presents sponsored bundles combining one store and one brand in ad slots. Unlike traditional models, joint advertising allows platforms to collect payments from both brands and stores. However, each of these two advertising models appeals to distinct user groups, leading to low click-through rates when users encounter an undesirable advertising model. To address this limitation and enhance generality, we propose a novel advertising model called ``Hybrid Advertising``. In this model, each ad slot can be allocated to either an independent store or a bundle. To find the optimal auction mechanisms in hybrid advertising, while ensuring nearly dominant strategy incentive compatibility and individual rationality, we introduce the Hybrid Regret Network (HRegNet), a neural network architecture designed for this purpose.

Recent advances in generative models, inspired by natural language processing, suggest the potential for unifying these stages to mitigate such loss.

By treating both stages as sequence generation tasks, UniGRF enables sufficient information sharing without additional computational costs, while remaining model-agnostic. To enhance inter-stage collaboration, UniGRF introduces a ranking-driven enhancer module that leverages the precision of the ranking stage to refine retrieval processes, creating an enhancement loop. Besides, a gradient-guided adaptive weighter is incorporated to dynamically balance the optimization of retrieval and ranking, ensuring synchronized performance improvements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniGRF significantly outperforms existing models on benchmark datasets, confirming its effectiveness in facilitating information transfer. Ablation studies and further experiments reveal that UniGRF not only promotes efficient collaboration between stages but also achieves synchronized optimization.

       "    'abstract': 'Despite their simplicity, linear autoencoder (LAE)-based models have shown comparable or even better performance with faster inference speed than neural recommender models. However, LAEs face two critical challenges: (i) popularity bias, which tends to recommend popular items, and (ii) neighborhood bias, which overly focuses on capturing local item correlations. To address these issues, this paper first analyzes the effects of two existing normalization methods for LAEs, i.e., random-walk and symmetric normalization. Our theoretical analysis reveals that normalization highly affects the degree of popularity and neighborhood biases among items. Inspired by this analysis, we propose a versatile normalization solution, called Data-Adaptive Normalization (DAN), which flexibly controls the popularity and neighborhood biases by adjusting item- and user-side normalization to align with unique dataset characteristics. Owing to its model-agnostic property, DAN can be easily applied to various LAE-based models. Experimental results show that DAN-equipped LAEs consistently improve existing LAE-based models across six benchmark datasets, with significant gains of up to 128.57% and 12.36% for long-tail items and unbiased evaluations, respectively.

These changes, altering the graph structure of KGs, are referred to as pattern shifts in this paper. Pattern shifts frequently arise as new facts are added, introducing significant challenges to the stability and adaptability of CKGE methods. To address this gap, we introduce a suite of novel and challenging benchmarks, called PS-CKGE, specifically designed to evaluate CKGE methods under pattern shifts, where logic rules are utilized to capture and manage structural changes in dynamic KGs. Through these benchmarks, we comprehensively evaluate current CKGE methods in terms of their overall performance, resistance to catastrophic forgetting, and adaptability to new knowledge. The results show that pattern shifts not only exacerbate their risk of catastrophic forgetting but also impair their adaptability, usually with greater performance degradation over triples associated with more significant changes.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The integration of social information into recommender systems (RSs) has gained significant popularity for enhancing recommendation performance and user experience. However, this practice introduces substantial privacy risks, particularly concerning the leakage of sensitive social relationships. While prior research has primarily focused on user-level and interaction-level privacy risks, the social relation-level privacy risks remain largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we investigate social privacy risks through membership inference attacks (MIA) and propose a Social relation-level MIA (SMIA) framework. Two key challenges arise: (1) the adversary can only access the recommended item IDs, which provide indirect and limited information about social relationships, and (2) extracting socially relevant preferences from recommendation results is inherently difficult. To tackle the first challenge, we leverage shadow models to transform sparse item IDs into dense features, enabling adversaries to effectively utilize recommendation outputs. For the second challenge, SMIA employs a dual-branch learning approach that disentangles social and behavioral preferences. Therefore, we can extract socially relevant signals from the disentangled preferences.Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that both social and general RSs are highly vulnerable to such attacks, highlighting the urgent need for robust privacy protection mechanisms. To defend against these attacks, we introduce a Socially Adversarial Learning (SAL) defense mechanism that selectively obscures sensitive social information in user representations during training, effectively reducing privacy leakage. We further evaluate the effectiveness of our defense and discuss future directions for developing privacy-preserving mechanisms in social RSs.',\n",

First, we show that the pre-trained encoder, which was not fine-tuned for retrieval, is sufficient for the retrieval process.  Then, we find that the pass through the decoder can be divided into three stages: (I) the priming stage in which no component contributes query-specific information, (II) the bridging stage where cross-attention transfers query information from the encoder to the decoder, and (III) the interaction stage where MLPs process this transferred information to predict the document identifier in the last layer. Our results indicate that document-specific information is only stored in a few components in the final stage of the retrieval process. We hope that our findings will motivate the development of more effective GenIR models and facilitate their improvements.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Sequential recommendation aims to learn users` dynamic preferences from their historical interactions and predict the next item they are most likely to engage with. In real-world scenarios, time-varying factors (e.g., product promotions, seasonal changes) induce distribution shifts in user interactions. Despite the demonstrated success of existing models, their generalization capability remains limited under such dynamic conditions.Current methods tackle this challenge by leveraging distributionally robust optimization (DRO) to optimize the \"worst-case\" loss or by employing manually designed data augmentation to enrich the training distribution. Despite their effectiveness, DRO-based approaches are inherently constrained by the sparsity of training data, limiting the range of distributions they can model, while manually designed augmentations risk introducing noise or irrelevant information that could distort user preference learning. Furthermore, these methods often overlook the sensitivity of user interactions to distribution shifts, which is essential for capturing the stable factors in the evolution of user preferences in real-world settings.In this work, we tackle the distribution shifting problem from the perspective of invariant learning. We propose a novel framework called \\\\textit{\\\\textbf{I}nvariant Learning for \\\\textbf{D}istribution Shifts in S\\\\textbf{E}quential Recommend\\\\textbf{A}tion (\\\\textbf{IDEA})} to develop robust sequential recommendation. The key of \\\\shortname~lies on learning stable preferences across various distribution-aware environments. Since explicit environments are unavailable, we first extract multiple subsequences by dropping potential noise items, then extend environments with our proposed subsequence mixup. Given the simulated environments, \\\\shortname~then learns stable user preferences through invariant risk minimization (IRM) across various environments. To encourage the diversity of simulated environments, \\\\shortname~employs an adversarial training strategy to explore potential diverse environments, and further enhance the model`s generalization to unseen test distributions. It is worth mentioning that \\\\shortname~is a flexible model-agnostic framework, which is applicable to various sequential recommendation models. Extensive experimental results on three public datasets clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Our code is available at: \\\\url{https://github.com/hermione314/IDEA}.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the capabilities of information access systems, especially with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Nevertheless, the evaluation of RAG systems remains a barrier to continued progress, a challenge we tackle in this work by proposing an automatic evaluation framework that is validated against human annotations. We believe that the nugget evaluation methodology provides a solid foundation for evaluating RAG systems. This approach, originally developed for the TREC Question Answering (QA) Track in 2003, evaluates systems based on atomic facts that should be present in good answers. Our efforts focus on \"refactoring\" this methodology, where we describe the AutoNuggetizer framework that specifically applies LLMs to both automatically create nuggets and automatically assign nuggets to system answers. In the context of the TREC 2024 RAG Track, we calibrate a fully automatic approach against strategies where nuggets are created manually or semi-manually by human assessors and then assigned manually to system answers. Based on results from a community-wide evaluation, we observe strong agreement at the run level between scores derived from fully automatic nugget evaluation and human-based variants. The agreement is stronger when individual framework components such as nugget assignment are automated independently. This suggests that our evaluation framework provides tradeoffs between effort and quality that can be used to guide the development of future RAG systems. However, further research is necessary to refine our approach, particularly in establishing robust per-topic agreement to diagnose system failures effectively.',\n",

To address these challenges, we proposed PRISM—Protection-enhanced Recommendation with Interest-aware Sequential Modeling—a novel framework based on diffusion models. PRISM harnesses the generative and control capabilities of diffusion models to progressively learn the implicit distribution of user interests from their reading history, thereby generating personalized recommendations that align with both their linguistic preferences and interest domains.

However, existing FedRec methods overlook two key challenges, i.e., (1) sufficiently explore the global item embedding space, and (2) effectively achieve local and global collaboration. The former is caused by client sparsity, which leads to suboptimal item embeddings and subsequently impacts the global item embedding in both the dimension and sample views. The latter arises from the lack of modeling the relative importance of local and global contributions to personalized user preferences. To address the above challenges, we propose FedIAR which contains two modules, i.e., item embedding dual-view exploration and adaptive local-global fusion. The first module enhances the global item embedding by reducing redundancy in the dimension view and capturing latent item relationships in the sample view, improving representational capacity. The second module enables the adaptive fusion of local and global item embeddings based on the user preference representation, achieving personalized optimum for recommendation.

Existing studies have explored various fusion paradigms and consistency constraints to improve the alignment of equivalent entities, while overlooking that the visual modality may not always contribute positively. Empirically, entities with low-similarity images usually generate unsatisfactory performance, highlighting the limitation of overly relying on visual features. We believe the model can be biased toward the visual modality, leading to a shortcut image-matching task. To address this, we propose a counterfactual debiasing framework for MMEA, termed CDMEA, which investigates visual modality bias from a causal perspective. Our approach aims to leverage both visual and graph modalities to enhance MMEA while suppressing the direct causal effect of the visual modality on model predictions. By estimating the Total Effect (TE) of both modalities and excluding the Natural Direct Effect (NDE) of the visual modality, we ensure that the model predicts based on the Total Indirect Effect (TIE), effectively utilizing both modalities and reducing visual modality bias.

Current endeavors for determining the usage of datasets mainly focus on single-modal dataset ownership verification through intrusive methods and non-intrusive techniques, while cross-modal approaches remain under-explored. Intrusive methods can adapt to multimodal datasets but degrade model accuracy, while non-intrusive methods rely on label-driven decision boundaries that fail to guarantee stable behaviors for verification. To address these issues, we propose a novel prompt-adapted transferable fingerprinting scheme from a training-free perspective, called PATFinger, which incorporates the global optimal perturbation (GOP) and the adaptive prompts to capture dataset-specific distribution characteristics. Our scheme utilizes inherent dataset attributes as fingerprints instead of compelling the model to learn triggers. The GOP is derived from the sample distribution to maximize embedding drifts between different modalities. Subsequently, our PATFinger re-aligns the adaptive prompt with GOP samples to capture the cross-modal interactions on the carefully crafted surrogate model. This allows the dataset owner to check the usage of datasets by observing specific prediction behaviors linked to the PATFinger during retrieval queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme against unauthorized multimodal dataset usage on various cross-modal retrieval architectures by 30% over state-of-the-art baselines.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Recent advancements have successfully harnessed the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) for zero-shot document ranking, exploring a variety of prompting strategies. Comparative approaches like pairwise and listwise achieve high effectiveness but are computationally intensive and thus less practical for larger-scale applications. Scoring-based pointwise approaches exhibit superior efficiency by independently and simultaneously generating the relevance scores for each candidate document. However, this independence ignores critical comparative insights between documents, resulting in inconsistent scoring and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we aim to improve the effectiveness of pointwise methods while preserving their efficiency through two key innovations: (1) We propose a novel Global-Consistent Comparative Pointwise Ranking (GCCP) strategy that incorporates global reference comparisons between each candidate and an anchor document to generate contrastive relevance scores. We strategically design the anchor document as a query-focused summary of pseudo-relevant candidates, which serves as an effective reference point by capturing the global context for document comparison. (2) These contrastive relevance scores can be efficiently Post-Aggregated with existing pointwise methods, seamlessly integrating essential Global Context information in a training-free manner (PAGC). Extensive experiments on the TREC DL and BEIR benchmark demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous pointwise methods while maintaining comparable efficiency. Our method also achieves competitive performance against comparative methods that require substantially more computational resources.

       "    'abstract': 'Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for generative recommendation has attracted significant research interest, where item tokenization is a critical step. It involves assigning item identifiers for LLMs to encode user history and generate the next item. Existing approaches leverage either token-sequence identifiers, representing items as discrete token sequences, or single-token identifiers, using ID or semantic embeddings. Token-sequence identifiers face issues such as the local optima problem in beam search and low generation efficiency due to step-by-step generation. In contrast, single-token identifiers fail to capture rich semantics or encode Collaborative Filtering (CF) information, resulting in suboptimal performance.To address these issues, we propose two fundamental principles for item identifier design: 1) integrating both CF and semantic information to fully capture multi-dimensional item information, and 2) designing order-agnostic identifiers without token dependency, mitigating the local optima issue and achieving simultaneous generation for generation efficiency. Accordingly, we introduce a novel set identifier paradigm for LLM-based generative recommendation, representing each item as a set of order-agnostic tokens. To implement this paradigm, we propose SETRec, which leverages CF and semantic tokenizers to obtain order-agnostic multi-dimensional tokens. To eliminate token dependency, SETRec uses a sparse attention mask for user history encoding and a query-guided generation mechanism for simultaneous token generation. We instantiate SETRec on T5 and Qwen (from 1.5B to 7B). Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate its effectiveness across various scenarios (e.g., full ranking, warm- and cold-start ranking, and various item popularity groups). Moreover, results validate SETRec`s superior efficiency and show promising scalability on cold-start items as model sizes increase.',\n",

Specifically, we design a heterogeneous edge dropping augmentation strategy, which preferentially preserves metapath-based edges with strong connection strength, thereby improving the homophily of augmented views. Moreover, we propose a multi-view self-expressive learning method to infer the homophily between nodes from the subspace. In practice, we develop two approaches to solve the self-expressive matrix.

In the face of such growing KG, relearning from scratch wastes acquired knowledge, while learning solely from new snapshots leads to model forgetting of old knowledge. Existing methods focus on lifelong learning in growing KG through transfer and regularize embeddings. However, extensive entity updates to adapt to new snapshots introduce conflicts between old and new knowledge, thereby resulting in the inevitable occurrence of knowledge forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose the Evolutionary Relation Path Passing (ERPP) model for lifelong knowledge graph embedding, aiming to shift from knowledge forgetting to knowledge accumulation, thereby achieving accurate long-term prediction. Specifically, we propose a snapshot conditional relation path passing strategy to generate expressive representations that better adapt to snapshots compared to the transferred embeddings in existing methods. Subsequently, we propose a relation inheritance and evolution mechanism across snapshots and continue relation path passing in next snapshots. This allows ERPP to avoid inevitable catastrophic forgetting from frequent entity embedding updates. ERPP outperforms SOTA models in 35 scenarios, with average improvements of 11.1% in long-term prediction and 12.9% in knowledge transfer. Moreover, ERPP makes a breakthrough in achieving knowledge positive accumulation, in contrast to the negative forgetting of existing models. To the best of our knowledge, ERPP is the first model to realize knowledge accumulation. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ERPP-6D66.',\n",

Although existing SBSR methods have achieved promising results, several challenges still require further investigation. First, most existing approaches usually leverage simple aggregation schemes, often failing to capture the intrinsic relationships between views, which limits the effectiveness of 3D shape feature extraction. Second, conventional SBSR primarily focuses on instance-level alignment while ignoring multi-level alignment, which may neglect complex hierarchical relationships. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Multi-level Encoding with Hierarchical Alignment (MEHA) method for SBSR. Specifically, we adopt spatial encoding and view encoding for multiple views of 3D shapes. The proposed aggregation scheme then integrates these multi-level embedded local features to enhance the representation of 3D shape features. Considering the complexity of 3D shapes, MEHA adopts a two-stage training process: the first stage focuses on learning 3D shape features, while the second stage emphasizes modality alignment. Furthermore, we introduce a hierarchical alignment strategy that bridges the modality gap through instance-level, prototype-level, and centre-level alignment.

This work explores how different information arrangements in 3D virtual space impact users` search behaviors and preferences.This paper presents the results of an exploratory within-subjects user study that investigated search behaviors, perceptions, and eye-tracking behaviors for four different spatial arrangements of search results (``list`` - 2D list; ``curve3`` - 3x3 curved grid; ``curve4`` - 4x4 curved grid; and ``sphere`` - 4x4 semi-spherical grid) in a virtual reality across two different task types (Find All relevant, Pick 3 best). Thirty-two (32) participants completed 5 search trials in 8 experimental conditions (4 displays x 2 task types) for 40 total search trials. The findings from our analysis show: (1) participants were accepting of and more often preferred using the more immersive displays than the conventional list display, (2) they generally preferred turning their heads (``physical navigation``) to scrolling (``virtual navigation``) for viewing results, (3) they perceived scrolling back up a display as an act of backtracking but did not perceived head movements to previously viewed results as backtracking, and (4) they spent less time gazing at the right-most columns in the exhaustive search task.

       "    'abstract': 'In today`s digital environment, the rapid propagation of fake news via social networks poses significant social challenges.   Most existing detection methods either employ traditional classification models, which suffer from low interpretability and limited generalization capabilities, or craft specific prompts for large language models (LLMs) to produce explanations and results directly, failing to leverage LLMs` reasoning abilities fully.  Inspired by the saying that ``truth becomes clearer through debate,`` our study introduces a novel multi-agent system with LLMs named TruEDebate (TED) to enhance the interpretability and effectiveness of fake news detection.   TED employs a rigorous debate process inspired by formal debate settings.  Central to our approach are two innovative components: the DebateFlow Agents and the InsightFlow Agents.  The DebateFlow Agents organize agents into two teams, where one supports and the other challenges the truth of the news. These agents engage in opening statements, cross-examination, rebuttal, and closing statements, simulating a rigorous debate process akin to human discourse analysis, allowing for a thorough evaluation of news content.  Concurrently, the InsightFlow Agents consist of two specialized sub-agents: the Synthesis Agent and the Analysis Agent. The Synthesis Agent summarizes the debates and provides an overarching viewpoint, ensuring a coherent and comprehensive evaluation.  The Analysis Agent, which includes a role-aware encoder and a debate graph, integrates role embeddings and models the interactions between debate roles and arguments using an attention mechanism, providing the final judgment.Our extensive experiments on two datasets, ARG-EN and ARG-CN, demonstrate that the TED framework surpasses traditional methods across various metrics and, more importantly, enhances interpretable fake news detection by illuminating logical reasoning and structured debate processes leading to accurate conclusions.We release our code to support Information systems that use structured debate within responsible information systems for improved decision-making.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'While Personalised PageRank (PPR) is widely used for ranking nodes in certain graphs, research on PPR for uncertain graphs remains limited. Real-world graphs often exhibit uncertainty in some edges with interdependent probabilities. The best-of-breed work by Kim et al. proposed a fast approximate algorithm, UPPR, leveraging the Sherman-Morrison formula with singular value decomposition. However, UPPR lacks error guarantees, and struggles to scale on large graphs due to the high cost to precompute block matrix inverses over the certain part of the graph. To address these problems, we propose UPPR+, an efficient scheme to retrieve PPR on billion-scale uncertain graphs. 1) We first propose an efficient approach that groupifies uncertain edges to remove duplicates of source node set and maps uncertainties into a small subspace using low-dimensional embeddings. 2) To further accelerate the computation, we devise a novel uncertain subspace reduction method and advance the aggregation of PPRs over all possible worlds within the subspace via ``subset embedding``. 3) We provide theoretical guarantees on the exactness of UPPR+ and analyse its time and space complexities. Extensive empirical studies on various real datasets validate that UPPR+ is 23–106x faster than state-of-the-art competitors, and scales well on billion-edge graphs without compromising accuracy.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Recent advancements in sequential recommendation have underscored the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhancing item embeddings. However, existing approaches face three key limitations: 1) the degradation of the semantic space when high-dimensional language embeddings are mapped to lower-dimensional ID embeddings, 2) the underutilization of language embeddings, and 3) the reliance on additional trainable parameters, such as an adapter, to bridge the gap between the semantic and behavior spaces. In this paper, we introduce AlphaFuse, a simple but effective language-guided learning strategy that addresses these challenges by learning ID embeddings within the null space of language embeddings. Specifically, we decompose the semantic space of language embeddings via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), distinguishing it into a semantic-rich row space and a semantic-sparse null space. Collaborative signals are then injected into the null space, while preserving the rich semantics of the row space. AlphaFuse prevents degradation of the semantic space, integrates the retained language embeddings into the final item embeddings, and eliminates the need for auxiliary trainable modules, enabling seamless adaptation to any sequential recommendation framework. We validate the effectiveness and flexibility of AlphaFuse through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, including cold-start user and long-tail settings, showcasing significant improvements in both discriminative and diffusion-based generative sequential recommenders.',\n",

Existing neural models primarily focus on capturing complex dependencies for sequential item transitions. As an alternative solution, linear item-item models mainly identify strong co-occurrence patterns across items and support faster inference speed. Although each paradigm has been actively studied in SBR, their fundamental differences in capturing item relationships and how to bridge these distinct modeling paradigms effectively remain unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel SBR model, namely Linear Item-Item model with Neural Knowledge (LINK), which integrates both types of knowledge into a unified linear framework. Specifically, we design two specialized components of LINK: (i) Linear knowledge-enhanced Item-item Similarity model (LIS), which refines the item similarity correlation via self-distillation, and (ii) Neural knowledge-enhanced Item-item Transition model (NIT), which seamlessly incorporates complicated neural knowledge distilled from the off-the-shelf neural model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LINK outperforms state-of-the-art linear SBR models across six real-world datasets, achieving improvements of up to 14.78% and 11.04% in Recall@20 and MRR@20 while showing up to 813x fewer inference FLOPs.

       "    'abstract': 'Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown strong capability in enhancing language models` knowledge and reducing AI generative hallucinations, driving its widespread use. However, complex tasks requiring multi-round retrieval remain challenging, and early attempts tend to be overly optimistic without a good sense of self-skepticism. Current multi-round RAG systems may continue searching even when enough information has already been retrieved, or they may provide incorrect answers without having sufficient information or knowledge. Existing solutions either require large amounts of expensive human-labeled process supervision data or lead to subpar performance.  This paper aims to address these limitations by introducing a new framework, SIM-RAG, to explicitly enhance RAG systems` self-awareness and multi-round retrieval capabilities. To train SIM-RAG, we first let a RAG system self-practice multi-round retrieval, augmenting existing question-answer pairs with intermediate inner monologue reasoning steps to generate synthetic training data. For each pair, the system may explore multiple retrieval paths, which are labeled as successful if they reach the correct answer and unsuccessful otherwise. Using this data, we train a lightweight information sufficiency Critic. At inference time, the Critic evaluates whether the RAG system has retrieved sufficient information at each round, guiding retrieval decisions and improving system-level self-awareness through in-context reinforcement learning. Experiments across multiple prominent RAG benchmarks show that SIM-RAG is an effective multi-round RAG solution. Furthermore, this framework is system-efficient, adding a lightweight component to RAG without requiring modifications to existing LLMs or search engines, and data-efficient, eliminating the need for costly human-annotated mid-step retrieval process supervision data.',\n",

The inferred preferences enable personalized ranking models to improve the relevance of documents to users. However, personalization is also seen as opaque in its use of historical interactions and is not amenable to users` control. Further, personalization limits the diversity of information users are exposed to. While search results may be automatically diversified this does little to address the lack of control over personalization. In response, we introduce a model for personalized search that enables users to control personalized rankings proactively. Our model, CtrlCE, is a novel cross-encoder model augmented with an editable memory built from users` historical interactions. The editable memory allows cross-encoders to be personalized efficiently and enables users to control personalized ranking. Next, because all queries do not require personalization, we introduce a calibrated mixing model which determines when personalization is necessary. This enables users to control personalization via their editable memory only when necessary. To thoroughly evaluate CtrlCE, we demonstrate its empirical performance in four domains of science, its ability to selectively request user control in a calibration evaluation of the mixing model, and the control provided by its editable memory in a user study.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Hateful memes are prevalent on the Internet, raising the urgent need for effective detection. Given their implicit nature, incorporating rationales with background knowledge is crucial for enhancing model understanding. However, existing methods often suffer from limited quality of external rationales and misalignment with original meme information. These challenges hinder model comprehension, leading to reduced accuracy and explainability. To address these challenges, we propose a Multimodal Multi-agent Knowledge Enhanced (M2KE) framework for hateful meme detection. M2KE introduces a multi-agent rationale discovery mechanism to extract high-quality rationales relevant to meme content and an adaptive knowledge interaction mechanism to ensure alignment between original meme information and external rationales. Specifically, multi-agent rationale discovery mechanism improves the reliability of rationales by collaboratively verifying and refining them with multiple agents, supported by large language models (LLMs) due to their extensive knowledge. And adaptive knowledge interaction mechanism uses information entropy to dynamically balance the model`s attention between original meme information and external rationales, preventing over-reliance on rationales and enabling a more comprehensive understanding. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that M2KE significantly outperforms existing models. Further analysis underscores the importance of effectively integrating accurate rationales to enhance model performance.',\n",

Existing TIC solutions either (i) fail to capture the rich text semantics due to the use of context-free text embeddings, and/or (ii) disregard the bipartite structure and node heterogeneity of TINs, leading to compromised TIC performance. In this work, we propose SAFT, a new architecture that integrates language- and graph-based modules for the effective fusion of textual and structural semantics in the representation learning of interactions. In particular, line graph attention (LGA)/gated attention units (GAUs) and pretrained language models (PLMs) are capitalized on to model the interaction-level and token-level signals, which are further coupled via the proxy token in an iterative and contextualized fashion. Additionally, an efficient and theoretically-grounded approach is developed to encode the local and global topology information pertaining to interactions into structural embeddings. The resulting embeddings not only inject the structural features underlying TINs into the textual interaction encoding but also facilitate the design of graph sampling strategies.

In this paper, we formally introduce the concept of relevant clip queries for the first time, providing a framework for querying relevant clips in a much more flexible way. To answer such queries efficiently, we propose the approximate query processing system ARC, which aims to maximize the recall and minimize the query overhead while ensuring the confidence of the query results. ARC adopts a proxy model to prune the original video repositories and uses an oracle model to refine the pruned results.

Despite these achievements, MLLMs still suffer from the visual object hallucination problem, where models produce plausible, yet incorrect, or irrelevant content not present in the input data. This issue arises from an over-reliance on ``bag-of-objects`` representations and language priors, leading to inadequate extraction of visual objects, along with their attributes and relationships. Existing methods to mitigate these hallucinations are limited by the significant human labor required and the coarse-grained nature. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Multimodal Contrastive Decoding (MMCD), a novel decoding approach that integrates graph-structured reasoning paths with contrastive decoding. MMCD mitigates object hallucinations induced by language priors and enhances the ability of MLLMs to extract and understand compositional information, without additional training or the usage of external tools. This is achieved by masking key objects in images, constructing perturbed scene graphs of attributes and relationships, then contrasting these with the original image and scene graph. Extensive evaluation across three distinct multimodal compositional reasoning tasks: spatial relationship reasoning, alignment of synthetic image and caption, and fine-grained object attribute understanding, show that MMCD consistently surpasses existing decoding methods when applied to various MLLMs. Moreover, MMCD achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, including the What`s Up, SeeTrue and SugarCrepe datasets.',\n",

Existing methods often use deep learning techniques to convert customer behaviors into implicit embeddings. However, these embeddings are difficult to understand and integrate with external knowledge, limiting the effectiveness of applications such as customer segmentation, search navigation, and product recommendations. To address this, our paper introduces the concept of the \\\\textit{customer persona}. Condensed from a customer`s numerous purchasing histories, a customer persona provides a multi-faceted and human-readable characterization of specific purchase behaviors and preferences, such as \\\\textit{Busy Parents} or \\\\textit{Bargain Hunters}.    This work then focuses on representing each customer by multiple personas from a predefined set, achieving readable and informative explicit user representations. To this end, we propose an effective and efficient solution GPLR. To ensure effectiveness, GPLR leverages pre-trained LLMs and few-shot learning to infer personas for customers. To reduce overhead, GPLR applies LLM-based labeling to only a fraction of users and utilizes a random walk technique to predict personas for the remaining customers. To further enhance efficiency, we propose an approximate solution called RevAff for this random walk-based computation. RevAff provides an absolute error $\\\\epsilon$ guarantee while improving the time complexity of the exact solution by a factor of at least $O\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\epsilon \\\\cdot |E| N}{|E| + N \\\\log N} \\\\right)$, where $N$ represents the number of customers and products, and $E$ represents the interactions between them.

Despite advancements, existing RAG methods still suffer from uncertainty of prediction during the multi-round retrieval-generation process, and a lack of the ability to balance the adequacy and redundancy of retrieved information. To address these challenges, we propose CIRAG, an approach that combines the RAG process with collective intelligence. Inspired by the crowd of wisdom, CIRAG simulates individual independent decision-making and information aggregation within a crowd. Specifically, CIRAG first enhances retrieval diversity by expanding queries based on extracted entities, then combines frequency-based and semantic-based reranking to form a multi granularity fusion reranking thereby assessing better relevance, and integrate multiple information sources for accurate content generation. By undertaking these steps in an integrated manner, CIRAG enables the model to acquire comprehensive and non-redundant information for generating responses. We conduct extensive experiments with HotPotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA datasets, popular benchmark for retrieval-based, multi-step question-answering. Experimental results show that our approach surpasses existing advanced RAG framework while providing high portability in query expansion as well as strong comprehensiveness exhibited in the collective intelligence.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'As an important graph pre-training method, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) continues to play a crucial role in the ongoing surge of research on graph foundation models or LLM as enhancer for graphs. Traditional GCL optimizes InfoNCE by using augmentations to define self-supervised tasks, treating augmented pairs as positive samples and others as negative. However, this leads to semantically similar pairs being classified as negative, causing significant sampling bias and limiting performance. In this paper, we argue that GCL is essentially a Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning problem, where the definition of self-supervised tasks should be semantically guided, i.e., augmented samples with similar semantics are considered positive, while others, with unknown semantics, are treated as unlabeled. From this perspective, the key lies in how to extract semantic information. To achieve this, we propose IFL-GCL, using InfoNCE as a ``free lunch`` to extract semantic information. Specifically, We first prove that under InfoNCE, the representation similarity of node pairs aligns with the probability that the corresponding contrastive sample is positive. Then we redefine the maximum likelihood objective based on the corrected samples, leading to a new InfoNCE loss function. Extensive experiments on both the graph pretraining framework and LLM as an enhancer show significantly improvements of IFL-GCL in both IID and OOD scenarios, achieving up to a 9.05% improvement, validating the effectiveness of semantically guided. Code for IFL-GCL is publicly available at: https://github.com/Camel-Prince/IFL-GCL.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Despite the vital role of recommendation systems (RS) in delivering personalized services tailored to users` needs, user fairness issues have increasingly emerged in recent years, especially differentiated treatments caused by user sensitive attributes. This not only undermines both user experience and platform revenues, but also leads to potential social unfairness. Although many fairness-aware methods have been developed and achieved some success, many of them filter out sensitive attribute information while ignoring the potential loss of personalized information, leading to suboptimal results. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, while their potential in fairness-aware recommendation remains further unexplored. In this paper, we propose a new exploration of fairness-aware RS by prompting LLMs with the user`s personalized fairness degrees to augment fair user-item interaction for training. Specifically, to estimate the fairness degree of each user, we first design a personalized unfairness modelling module, consisting of a replaceable fairness-aware representation learning model. Moreover, to enable LLMs to perceive fairness from semantic information and adapt to various scenarios, we propose a prompt tuning mechanism to optimize user-shared prompt templates with the objective of maximizing the consistency with users` preferences and the diversity of augmented data. Finally, we utilize LLMs to augment fair interaction data with the optimal prompts and integrate it with the raw data to re-train the recommendation model. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach in terms of recommendation performance, fairness, and robustness.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention in recommender systems for their excellent world knowledge capabilities. However, existing methods that rely on Euclidean space struggle to capture the rich hierarchical information inherent in textual and semantic data, which is essential for capturing user preferences. The geometric properties of hyperbolic space offer a promising solution to address this issue. Nevertheless, integrating LLMs-based methods with hyperbolic space to effectively extract and incorporate diverse hierarchical information is non-trivial. To this end, we propose a model-agnostic framework, named \\\\textbf{HyperLLM}, which extracts and integrates hierarchical information from both structural and semantic perspectives. Structurally, HyperLLM uses LLMs to generate multi-level classification tags with hierarchical parent-child relationships for each item. Then, tag-item and user-item interactions are jointly learned and aligned through contrastive learning, thereby providing the model with clear hierarchical information. Semantically, HyperLLM introduces a novel meta-optimized strategy to extract hierarchical information from semantic embeddings and bridge the gap between the semantic and collaborative spaces for seamless integration. Extensive experiments show that HyperLLM significantly outperforms recommender systems based on hyperbolic space and LLMs, achieving performance improvements of over 40\\\\%. Furthermore, HyperLLM not only improves recommender performance but also enhances training stability, highlighting the critical role of hierarchical information in recommender systems.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Large language model-based agents are increasingly applied in the recommendation field due to their extensive knowledge and strong planning capabilities. While prior research has primarily focused on enhancing either the recommendation agent or the user agent individually, the collaborative interaction between the two has often been overlooked. Towards this research gap, we propose a novel framework that emphasizes the feedback loop process to facilitate the collaboration between the recommendation agent and the user agent. Specifically, the recommendation agent refines its understanding of user preferences by analyzing the feedback from the user agent on the item recommendation. Conversely, the user agent further identifies potential user interests based on the items and recommendation reasons provided by the recommendation agent. This iterative process enhances the ability of both agents to infer user behaviors, enabling more effective item recommendations and more accurate user simulations. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the agentic feedback loop: the agentic feedback loop yields an average improvement of 11.52% over the single recommendation agent and 21.12% over the single user agent. Furthermore, the results show that the agentic feedback loop does not exacerbate popularity or position bias, which are typically amplified by the real-world feedback loop, highlighting its robustness.

       "    'abstract': 'Self-improving alignment leveraging large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate synthetic preference data has garnered significant attention as a means of reducing reliance on human labelers. These methods typically employ the LLM-as-a-judge mechanism, where the LLM generates responses and then employs itself to judge which response best aligns with the given prompt for curating the binary self-preferred dataset. However, these methods encounter two major challenges: (1) LLM-as-a-judge often produces error-prone evaluations, resulting in low-quality preference annotation, and (2) their optimization strategies often overlook the strength of preferences within binary pairs, leading to overfitting. This paper proposes a novel method, Preference-Strength-aware Optimization (PSO), to address these issues. Specifically, PSO frames the preference annotation process as a judgment token prediction task using the generative preference model to produce reliable judgments. The predicted judgment token indicates the preferred response and its corresponding probability reflects the disparity between responses, referred to as preference strength. Based on this strength, we introduce a new preference-strength-aware loss to adaptively reweight the impact of different response pairs on optimization, concentrating the model`s learning on high-quality response pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that PSO significantly improves performance in preference benchmarks, achieving stronger alignment with human preferences, reducing verbose responses, and mitigating overfitting. Furthermore, PSO exhibits robust generalization and sample efficiency, offering a scalable and promising solution for LLM alignment without relying on human-annotated preferences.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Large Language Model (LLM) agents frequently produce sub-optimal actions when tackling complex, multi-step decision-making tasks. Employing self-critique to identify flaws and suggest enhancements is an effective strategy for refining actions. Although trajectory-level critique is commonly employed, it often fails to identify flawed steps accurately. In this paper, we introduce SLSC-MCTS, a method that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search with Step-Level Self-Critique to enhance LLM agents during both testing and self-training phases. During decision tree expansion with SLSC-MCTS, the LLM agent initially generates an action, receives environmental feedback, and subsequently generates further actions via self-critique and refinement. Through multiple episodes of SLSC-MCTS, LLM agents can effectively utilize step-level critiques while disregarding ineffective ones based on node values, thereby incorporating the critiques more robustly. Additionally, our method further empowers LLM agents in a self-training manner, collecting training data from the constructed decision tree to iteratively fine-tune the LLM agents. The self-training data gathered via SLSC-MCTS is diverse and high-quality, which further enhances the reasoning, critiquing, and refining abilities of LLM agents. Experimental results demonstrate that SLSC-MCTS significantly improves LLM agents during testing, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines and achieving shorter task completion trajectories across information retrieval benchmarks such as WebShop and HotPotQA. After three iterations of self-training, LLM agents established by Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct show substantial improvement, even surpassing human experts in WebShop.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Deep learning models usually require large labeled datasets to generalize well, but this is computationally and financially costly. Cold-start few-shot data selection enables fast model generalization by selecting a few diverse, representative samples from an unlabeled data pool. To achieve this goal, previous work usually divides the training data into several clusters and performs sampling from these clusters. Yet, such a way tends to have two issues. First, imbalanced data distribution in the training data pool still exists in the selected subset, causing models` performance biases and suboptimal generalization ability. Second, these methods improve sample diversity in each cluster by considering either the feature dissimilarity among instances, or model uncertainty for individual instance. They ignore the entire representativeness of samples within a cluster. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework HCDS : Hierarchical Clustering for Cold-Start Few-Shot Data Selection. Specifically, we first perform class-level clustering, using pseudo-labels for class supervision and applying contrastive clustering to derive class-rich features. We then refine these features within the class-level clusters into semantically meaningful features and perform representation-level clustering. Finally, we sample data from the representation-level clusters based on global similarity to ensure representativeness. Experimental results on six public datasets, including both balanced and imbalanced ones, show that HCDS achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly with limited and imbalanced data.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Ranking models primarily focus on modeling the relative order of predictions while often neglecting the significance of the accuracy of their absolute values. However, accurate absolute values are essential for certain downstream tasks, necessitating the calibration of the original predictions. To address this, existing calibration approaches typically employ predefined transformation functions with order-preserving properties to adjust the original predictions. Unfortunately, these functions often adhere to fixed forms, such as piece-wise linear functions, which exhibit limited expressiveness and flexibility, thereby constraining their effectiveness in complex calibration scenarios. To mitigate this issue, we propose implementing a calibrator using an Unconstrained Monotonic Neural Network (UMNN), which can learn arbitrary monotonic functions with great modeling power. This approach significantly relaxes the constraints on the calibrator, improving its flexibility and expressiveness while avoiding excessively distorting the original predictions by requiring monotonicity. Furthermore, to optimize this highly flexible network for calibration, we introduce a novel additional loss function termed Smooth Calibration Loss (SCLoss), which aims to fulfill a necessary condition for achieving the ideal calibration state. Extensive offline experiments confirm the effectiveness of our method in achieving superior calibration performance. Moreover, deployment in Kuaishou`s large-scale online video ranking system demonstrates that the method`s calibration improvements translate into enhanced business metrics.

The core of our MultiEmb is to introduce an instance embedding selection network to effectively complete the above challenging tasks, in which a set of feature selection and dimension selection adaptive components are equipped for each scenario, and their combination completes the optimal embedding selection for each instance.

However, systematic investigations into user behavior and search experience on generative IR systems are notably lacking. To address this gap, we conducted a user study using Bing Chat to explore user behavior and feedback on generative IR systems.

During the search process, we collected their various behavior (e.g., click, query reformulation) and explicit feedback (e.g., satisfaction, credibility, and success). Additionally, the same study was conducted on traditional IR systems Bing for comparison.

       "    'abstract': 'This work proposes Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) as a design paradigm [13] to facilitate search and recommendation activities for disabled users employing symbolic augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems. Such a context necessitates flexibility and composability in item and query representations as a consequence of vocabularies being tailored to an individual user. HDC is suggested to meet these needs in an efficient manner. However, construction and empirical evaluation are left to additional research.  Project development for symbolic AAC supports a small but highly diverse user base. This creates a ``low resource environment`` from both an economic and technical perspective. The heterogeneity of user communication abilities, preferences, and symbolic interpretation limits the generalisability of datasets and presents a cold start problem. Furthermore, countries with underdeveloped social welfare and health infrastructure, the Philippines serving as an illustrative example, have few practitioners able to fine-tune AAC devices or support inclusive decision making. Consequently, this exacerbates resource constraints, which motivates systems to offer consumer-level ease of use. Rural areas, in any socioeconomic setting, lack reliable network connectivity: designers should anticipate regular on-device computation, leaving networked tasks to limited occasions. Technologies for disabilities, broadly speaking, are related to all 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals [21]. Additionally, AAC is a focus area of UNICEF`s work on disabilities and inclusion for marginalised children [2].  By proposing HDC as a way to mediate diverse feature spaces, search and recommendation applications are able to reuse semantic components and process structures --- reducing costs. This flexibility enables adaptation to underserved cultures, where localised symbol interpretations are particularly needed [3]. A similar approach has been taken to circulate open access symbols [2]. HDC`s development comes from an interdisciplinary perspective, implementing cognitive and linguistic science precepts computationally [8]. Building on this idea, AAC for search requires wider collaboration with entities outside the traditional information retrieval (IR) community, such as speech pathologists, disability support workers, and end users with disabilities.',\n",

This work also contributes to achieving sustainable development goals, specifically goal 2: Zero hunger and goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. Actually, given that a lot of African food data is accessible only in PDF format, we firstly extracted and organized these data using the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) and the image data using the Firebase database, with the link to the corresponding food description in the ORKG. Currently, more than 1000 foods eaten in around 50 African countries are already documented. Given that Large Language Models necessitate a lot of data and resources to be train/fine-tuned, which we do not have in our university, our idea is to use the food data stored in the ORKG to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation system (RAG) for improving access to food data in Africa. Its implementation involved the use of multi-embedding models, vector databases (Pinecone), Falcon3 and LangChain. Because we do not have enough resources, this work is made possible thanks to a collaboration with TIB-Hannover who provide access to remote computers.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Millions of consumers search for products online each day, aiming to find items that meet their needs at an acceptable price. While price and quality are major factors in purchasing decisions, ethical considerations increasingly influence consumer behavior -giving rise to the socially responsible consumer. Insights from a recent survey of over 600 consumers reveal that many barriers to ethical shopping stem from information-seeking challenges, often leading to decisions made under uncertainty. These challenges contribute to the intention–behaviour gap, where consumers` desire to make ethical choices is undermined by limited or inaccessible information and inefficacy of search systems in supporting responsible decision-making. In this perspectives paper, we argue that the field of Information Retrieval (IR) has a critical role to play by empowering consumers to make more informed and more responsible choices. We present three interrelated perspectives: (1) reframing ethical consumption as an information extraction problem aimed at reducing information asymmetries; (2) redefining product search as a complex task requiring interfaces that lower the cost and burden of responsible search; and (3) reimagining search as a process of knowledge calibration that helps consumers bridge gaps in awareness when making purchasing decisions. Taken together, these perspectives outline a path from query to conscience - one where IR systems help transform everyday product searches into opportunities for more ethical and informed choices. We advocate for the development of new and novel IR systems and interfaces that address the intricacies of socially responsible consumerism, and call on the IR community to build technologies that make ethical decisions more informed, convenient, and aligned with economic realities.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Advancements in large language models (LLMs) have driven the emergence of complex new systems to provide access to information, that we will collectively refer to as modular generative information access (GenIA) systems. They integrate a broad and evolving range of specialized components, including LLMs, retrieval models, and a heterogeneous set of sources and tools. While modularity offers flexibility, it also raises critical challenges: How can we systematically characterize the space of possible modules and their interactions? How can we automate and optimize interactions among these heterogeneous components? And, how do we enable this modular system to dynamically adapt to varying user query requirements and evolving module capabilities?  In this perspective paper, we argue that the architecture of future modular generative information access systems will not just assemble powerful components, but enable a self-organizing system through real-time adaptive orchestration -- where components` interactions are dynamically configured for each user input, maximizing information relevance while minimizing computational overhead. We give provisional answers to the questions raised above with a roadmap that depicts the key principles and methods for designing such an adaptive modular system. We identify pressing challenges, and propose avenues for addressing them in the years ahead. This perspective urges the IR community to rethink modular system designs for developing adaptive, self-optimizing, and future-ready architectures that evolve alongside their rapidly advancing underlying technologies.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'For decades, scholars have emphasized that tasks should be the central focus in Information Retrieval (IR). This point of view holds even more significance with the advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models, which can, among other capabilities, understand natural language, engage in dialog with users, generate bespoke user interfaces, and power agents to help complete tasks. GenAI presents an unprecedented opportunity to finally realize the potential of tasks in IR, enhance task-focused retrieval and interaction, and create ``magical`` task completion moments for users. In this paper, we explore the rationale and methodology behind this argument. Traditional IR systems support mostly simple tasks. The emergence of GenAI creates an opportunity for IR systems to help users achieve complex tasks and for the IR community to rekindle its interest and demonstrate leadership in this sizable and significant problem space. We underscore the pivotal role of tasks in IR and introduce new evidence supporting the notion that task-centric approaches, abstracted from specific modalities, represent the future of IR. Building on this foundation, we envision the development, utilization, and evaluation of next-generation IR systems. We propose a promising future where IR agents prioritize users, their tasks, and their situations. However, despite their potential to address task-focused and modality-independent IR, agents alone are insufficient. We propose a robust ecosystem around these agents that transcends traditional queries, questions, prompts, and modalities to address users` fundamental needs, tasks, and goals.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Generative AI search driven by large language models (LLMs) is reshaping information retrieval by offering end-to-end answers to complex queries, reducing users` reliance on manually browsing and summarizing multiple web pages. However, while this paradigm enhances convenience, it disrupts the feedback-driven improvement loop that has historically powered the evolution of traditional Web search. Web search can continuously improve their ranking models by collecting large-scale, fine-grained user feedback (e.g., clicks, dwell time) at the document level. In contrast, generative AI search operates through a much longer search pipeline—spanning query decomposition, document retrieval, and answer generation—yet typically receives only coarse-grained feedback on the final answer. This introduces a feedback loop disconnect, where user feedback for the final output cannot be effectively mapped back to specific system components, making it difficult to improve each intermediate stage and sustain the feedback loop. To address this limitation, we envision NExT-Search, a next-generation paradigm designed to reintroduce fine-grained, process-level feedback into generative AI search. NExT-Search integrates two complementary modes: User Debug Mode, which allows engaged users to intervene at key stages—such as refining query decomposition, rating retrieved documents, and editing initial generated responses—and Shadow User Mode, where a personalized user agent simulates user preferences and provides AI-assisted feedback for less interactive users. As these feedback signals serve as valuable resources for refining the whole search pipeline, we also introduce a feedback store mechanism that encourages users to share and monetize their debugging efforts, further incentivizing participation. Furthermore, we envision how these feedback signals can be leveraged through online adaptation, which refines current search outputs in real-time, and offline update, which aggregates interaction logs to periodically fine-tune query decomposition, retrieval, and generation models. By restoring human control over key stages of the generative AI search pipeline, we believe NExT-Search offers a promising direction for building feedback-rich AI search systems that can evolve continuously alongside human feedback.',\n",

Traditional accuracy metrics cannot fully capture these challenges, as they fail to measure factual correctness, content safety, or alignment with user intent. This paper makes two main contributions. First, we categorize the evaluation challenges of Gen-RecSys into two groups: (i) existing concerns that are exacerbated by generative outputs (e.g., bias, privacy) and (ii) entirely new risks (e.g., item hallucinations, contradictory explanations). Second, we propose a holistic evaluation approach that includes scenario-based assessments and multi-metric checks—incorporating relevance, factual grounding, bias detection, and policy compliance. Our goal is to provide a guiding framework so that researchers and practitioners can thoroughly assess Gen-RecSys, ensuring both effective personalization and responsible deployment.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The Anserini IR toolkit has come a long way since efforts began in 2015. Although the goals of the project — to bridge research and practice in information retrieval, and to provide reproducible, easy-to-use baselines — have remained constant, the world has changed quite a bit. We discuss how Anserini has evolved in response to this changing environment, the most significant of which is the advent of transformer-based retrieval models that did not exist when the project started. The bi-encoder architecture provides a framework for understanding retrieval models based on dense and sparse vector representations, and offers a reference for conveying the capabilities of our toolkit. Anserini provides end-to-end first-stage retrieval based on single-vector learned dense and sparse representations, directly building on the open-source Lucene search library and the ONNX runtime. This minimal design accelerates the pace of research and fosters reproducibility, enabling ``two-click reproductions``. By better aligning research and practice, we increase the potential real-world impact of research innovations.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'When a paired or two-sample t-test shows that a difference is not statistically significant (i.e., the null hypothesis H is \"accepted\"), all we obtain as a \"conclusion\" is: \" we cannot conclude from the data whether the difference is real or not. \" In general, statistical significance tests with a significance level of α give us a proper conclusion with 100(1-α)% confidence only if the H is rejected. Hence, for example, in a reproducibility study in IR, traditional significance tests like the t-test are not adequate if one wishes to claim that the reproduced run is as good as the target run. In this paper, we show that the equivalence test, which has been gaining popularity in the medical domain for comparing new drugs with standard drugs, is applicable to IR research in situations such as above. We also discuss the less ambitious noninferiority test, which can be used, for example, when an IR researcher wants to claim that their system performs no worse than a state-of-the-art system that is computationally much more expensive and therefore earth-unfriendly. The equivalence and noninferiority tests require researchers to pre-define an indifference zone, which defines how much difference is \"practically negligible\"; hence we also discuss one possible approach to establishing an indifference zone for a given IR effectiveness measure. In addition, we provide recommendations for IR researchers who wish to conduct equivalence/noninferiority tests involving more than two systems. It is hoped that equivalence and noninferiority tests will become standard practices in IR, so that we can avoid making claims based on lack of statistical significance.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Visual Document Retrieval (VDR) is an emerging research area that focuses on encoding and retrieving document images directly, bypassing the dependence on Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for document search. A recent advance in VDR was introduced by ColPali, which significantly improved retrieval effectiveness through a late interaction mechanism. ColPali`s approach demonstrated substantial performance gains over existing baselines that do not use late interaction on an established benchmark. In this study, we investigate the reproducibility and replicability of VDR methods with and without late interaction mechanisms by systematically evaluating their performance across multiple pre-trained vision-language models. Our findings confirm that late interaction yields considerable improvements in retrieval effectiveness; however, it also introduces computational inefficiencies during inference. Additionally, we examine the adaptability of VDR models to textual inputs and assess their robustness across text-intensive datasets within the proposed benchmark, particularly when scaling the indexing mechanism. Furthermore, our research investigates the specific contributions of late interaction by looking into query-patch matching in the context of visual document retrieval. We find that although query tokens cannot explicitly match image patches as in the text retrieval scenario, they tend to match the patch contains visually similar tokens or their surrounding patches.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful listwise rerankers but remain prohibitively slow for many real-world applications. What`s more, training on the language modeling (LM) objective is not intrinsically aligned with reranking tasks. To address these challenges, FIRST, a novel approach for listwise reranking, integrates a learning-to-rank objective and leverages only the logits of the first generated token for reranking, significantly reducing computational overhead while preserving effectiveness. We systematically evaluate the capabilities and limitations of FIRST. By extending its evaluation to TREC Deep Learning collections (DL19-23), we show that FIRST achieves robust out-of-domain effectiveness. Through training FIRST on a variety of backbone models, we demonstrate its generalizability across different model architectures, and achieve effectiveness surpassing the original implementation. Further analysis of the interaction between FIRST and various first-stage retrievers reveals diminishing returns akin to traditional LLM rerankers. A comprehensive latency study confirms that FIRST consistently delivers a 40% efficiency gain over traditional rerankers without sacrificing effectiveness. Notably, while LM training implicitly improves zero-shot single-token reranking, our experiments also highlight potential conflicts between LM pre-training and subsequent fine-tuning on the FIRST objective. These findings pave the way for more efficient and effective listwise reranking in future applications. Our code is available at: https://rankllm.ai.',\n",

Regulators, as well as researchers, are calling for systematic social media algorithmic audits as this shift leads to enclosing users in filter bubbles and leading them to more problematic content. An important aspect of such audits is the reproducibility and generalisability of their findings, as it allows to draw verifiable conclusions and audit potential changes in algorithms over time. In this work, we study the reproducibility of the existing sockpuppeting audits of TikTok recommender systems, and the generalizability of their findings. In our efforts to reproduce the previous works, we find multiple challenges stemming from social media platform changes and content evolution, but also the research works themselves. These drawbacks limit the audit reproducibility and require an extensive effort altogether with inevitable adjustments to the auditing methodology. Our experiments also reveal that these one-shot audit findings often hold only in the short term, implying that the reproducibility and generalizability of the audits heavily depend on the methodological choices and the state of algorithms and content on the platform. This highlights the importance of reproducible audits that allow us to determine how the situation changes in time.',\n",

Several studies report Kendall $\\\\tau$ correlations exceeding $0.85$ when comparing system rankings derived from human versus LLM-generated relevance labels. Previous work on LLM-based relevance assessment has primarily focused on replicating graded human relevance judgments through various prompting strategies. However, there has been limited exploration of alternative assessment methods or comprehensive comparative studies. In this paper, we systematically compare multiple LLM-based relevance assessment methods, including binary relevance judgments, graded relevance assessments, pairwise preference-based methods, and two nugget-based evaluation methods~--~document-agnostic and document-dependent. Wherever possible, we employ state-of-the-art tools and optimized prompts tailored for these methods. In addition to a traditional comparison based on system rankings using Kendall correlations, we also examine how well LLM judgments align with human preferences, as inferred from relevance grades. We conduct extensive experiments on datasets from three TREC Deep Learning tracks 2019, 2020 and 2021 as well as the ANTIQUE dataset, which focuses on non-factoid open-domain question answering. Beyond dataset-specific results, our work offers a practical methodology for evaluating diverse LLM-based relevance assessment methods.

       "    'abstract': 'Counterfactual learning to rank (CLTR) has attracted extensive attention in the IR community for its ability to leverage massive logged user interaction data to train ranking models. While the CLTR models can be theoretically unbiased when the user behavior assumption is correct and the propensity estimation is accurate, their effectiveness is usually empirically evaluated via simulation-based experiments due to a lack of widely available, large-scale, real click logs. However, many previous simulation-based experiments are somewhat limited because they may have one or more of the following deficiencies: 1) using a weak production ranker to generate initial ranked lists, 2) relying on a simplified user simulation model to simulate user clicks, and 3) generating a fixed number of synthetic click logs. As a result, the robustness of CLTR models in complex and diverse situations is largely unknown and needs further investigation. To address this problem, in this paper, we aim to investigate the robustness of existing CLTR models in a reproducibility study with extensive simulation-based experiments that (1) use production rankers with different ranking performance, (2) leverage multiple user simulation models with different user behavior assumptions, and (3) generate different numbers of synthetic sessions for the training queries. We find that the IPS-DCM, DLA-PBM, and UPE models show better robustness under various simulation settings than other CLTR models. Moreover, existing CLTR models often fail to outperform naive click baselines when the production ranker is strong and the number of training sessions is limited, indicating a pressing need for new CLTR algorithms tailored to these conditions.',\n",

Since then, there have been significant technological advances in emotion detection and information access. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive reproducibility study where we probe today`s emotional profile of SE using both a lexicon-based and a language-model based approach tailored to the Italian language, thus addressing an acknowledged limitation of the original study. Additionally, considering the prevalence of agents based on Large Language Models (LLM) as information access systems among children, we extend the analysis to capture the emotional undertones of LLM responses and juxtapose them to those of SE. Our findings emphasize the importance of leveraging the appropriate emotion detection technique to produce and explore emotional profiles and lead us to reflect on the interplay of emotions on children`s search-as-learning experience.',\n",

Despite strong empirical performance, its theoretical foundations and generalizability remain open questions.  In this paper, we propose four key contributions. First, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of DIME, framing it as a denoising mechanism that mitigates embedding noise while preserving the salient information. Second, we conduct a comprehensive reproducibility study, confirming previously reported gains for both PRF DIME and LLM DIME. Third, we extend the evaluations of PRF DIME by applying it to a broader set of embedding models with distinct characteristics, such as matryoshka embeddings, cosine similarity-optimized models, and architectures that produce high-dimensional representations, while also testing it on diverse retrieval datasets. For LLM DIME, we expand the analysis across a range of LLMs, comparing high-parameter proprietary models with cheaper open-source alternatives.

This method has demonstrated higher effectiveness in Semantic Text Similarity (STS) tasks over traditional training approaches when using sub-layers for embeddings.

In this reproducibility study, we implement and evaluate both versions of 2D Matryoshka Training on STS tasks and extend our analysis to retrieval tasks. Our findings indicate that while both versions achieve higher effectiveness than traditional Matryoshka training on sub-dimensions, and traditional full-sized model training approaches, they do not outperform models trained separately on specific sub-layer and sub-dimension setups. Moreover, these results generalize well to retrieval tasks, both in supervised (MSMARCO) and zero-shot (BEIR) settings. Further explorations of different loss computations reveals more suitable implementations for retrieval tasks, such as incorporating full-dimension loss and training on a broader range of target dimensions.

Experimental results across multiple LLM architectures - Flan-T5, Vicuna, and Llama - show that Setwise Insertion yields a 31% reduction in query time, a 23% reduction in model inferences, and a slight improvement in reranking effectiveness compared to the original Setwise method.

A critical step in this process is the development of complex Boolean queries to retrieve relevant literature. Given the difficulty of manually constructing these queries, recent efforts have explored Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in their formulation. One of the first studies, Wang et al. [21], investigated ChatGPT for this task, followed by Staudinger et al. [14], which evaluated multiple LLMs in a reproducibility study. However, the latter overlooked several key aspects of the original work, including (i) validation of generated queries, (ii) output formatting constraints, and (iii) selection of examples for chainof- thought (Guided) prompting. As a result, its findings diverged significantly from the original study. In this work, we systematically reproduce both studies while addressing these overlooked factors. Our results show that query effectiveness varies significantly across models and prompt designs, with guided query formulation benefiting from well-chosen seed studies. Overall, prompt design and model selection are key drivers of successful query formulation. Our findings provide a clearer understanding of LLMs’ potential in Boolean query generation and highlight the importance of modeland prompt-specific optimisations. The complex nature of systematic reviews adds to challenges in both developing and reproducing methods but also highlights the importance of reproducibility studies in this domain.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Dense retrievers utilize pre-trained backbone language models (e.g., BERT, LLaMA) that are fine-tuned via contrastive learning to perform the task of encoding text into sense representations that can be then compared via a shallow similarity operation, e.g. inner product. Recent research has questioned the role of fine-tuning vs. that of pre-training within dense retrievers, specifically arguing that retrieval knowledge is primarily gained during pre-training, meaning knowledge not acquired during pre-training cannot be sub-sequentially acquired via fine-tuning. We revisit this idea here as the claim was only studied in the context of a BERT-based encoder using DPR as representative dense retriever. We extend the previous analysis by testing other representation approaches (comparing the use of CLS tokens with that of mean pooling), backbone architectures (encoder-only BERT vs. decoder-only LLaMA), and additional datasets (MSMARCO in addition to Natural Questions). Our study confirms that in DPR tuning, pre-trained knowledge underpins retrieval performance, with fine-tuning primarily adjusting neuron activation rather than reorganizing knowledge. However, this pattern does not hold universally, such as in mean-pooled (Contriever) and decoder-based (LLaMA) models.

In such cases, LLMs often produce hallucinated answers without flagging them.

       "    'abstract': 'Offline evaluation of recommender systems has traditionally treated the problem as a machine learning problem.  In the classic case of recommending movies, where the user has provided explicit ratings of which movies they like and don`t like, each user`s ratings are split into test and train sets, and the evaluation task becomes to predict the held out test data using the training data.  This machine learning style of evaluation makes the objective to recommend the movies that a user has watched and rated highly, which is not the same task as helping the user find movies that they would enjoy if they watched them. This mismatch in objective between evaluation and task is a compromise to avoid the cost of asking a user to evaluate recommendations by watching each movie.  As a resource available for download, we offer an extension to the MovieLens-32M dataset that provides for new evaluation objectives. Our primary objective is to predict the movies that a user would be interested in watching, i.e. predict their watchlist.  To construct this extension, we recruited MovieLens users, collected their profiles, made recommendations with a diverse set of algorithms, pooled the recommendations, and had the users assess the pools.  This paper demonstrates the feasibility of using pooling to construct a test collection for recommender systems.  Notably, we found that the traditional machine learning style of evaluation ranks the Popular algorithm, which recommends movies based on total number of ratings in the system, in the middle of the twenty-two recommendation runs we used to build the pools.  In contrast, when we rank the runs by users` interest in watching movies, we find that recommending popular movies as a recommendation algorithm becomes one of the worst performing runs.  It appears that by asking users to assess their personal recommendations, we can alleviate the issue of popularity bias in the evaluation of top-n recommendation.',\n",

Consequently, Explainability and Interpretability have emerged as important research topics in IR. Several axiomatic and post-hoc explanation methods, as well as approaches that attempt to be interpretable-by-design, have been proposed. We present ir_explain, an open-source Python library that implements a variety of well-known techniques for Explainable IR (ExIR) within a common, extensible framework.

The library is designed to make it easy to reproduce state-of-the-art ExIR baselines on standard test collections, as well as to explore new approaches to explaining IR models and methods. To facilitate adoption, ir_explain is well-integrated with widely-used toolkits such as Pyserini, PyTerrier (work in progress) and ir_datasets. Downstream applications of ir_explain include explaining the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. The development version of the library is available on GitHub.

These constraints can hinder model iteration and lead to incomplete ranking, causing regressions in user experience and ad performance.To address these issues, we analyzed ad ranking metrics and found that ad rankings for individual users remain relatively stable over short periods. Based on this insight, we introduce Negative Exclusion Filtering, a framework that optimizes the balance between ranked ad volume and computing resources. By skipping re-ranking of consistently low-ranked ads for each user request, it reduces computing cost in large-scale social media environments.Negative Exclusion Filtering has achieved CPU reductions of 3.7-7.4\\\\% and GPU reductions of 4.0-7.9\\\\% in power consumption across various Meta products, along with a 0.5-2.0\\\\% reduction in latency, all while maintaining recommendation quality and performance.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Accurate Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is vital for search engines and recommendation systems, yet it is often hindered by the \"cold start problem\", which arises from insufficient historical data for new users. Recent approaches have sought to tackle this by training encoder-decoder networks on data from warm users to generate virtual behavior embeddings for cold users. However, these methods have shortcomings in terms of simplistic encoding techniques for warm user behaviors and direct utilization of virtual behavior embeddings, leading to limitations in user interest expression and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method that leverages Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) for cohort modeling within CTR prediction. GIN effectively captures high-order user-item interactions, providing a more nuanced understanding of users` diverse interests. Additionally, the cohort modeling strategy minimizes deviations in constructed embeddings, enhancing the model`s generalization abilities. We validate our approach through experiments on public and industrial datasets, demonstrating significant improvements for both warm and cold users compared to existing methodologies. Furthermore, we implemented the GIN Cohort Modeling (GINCM) in a large-scale online advertising system, optimizing for both pre-computation and real-time processing to reduce latency. The implementation yields notable enhancements of 2.13% in CTR and Revenue Per Mille(RPM), showcasing the practical effectiveness and real-world applicability of our model.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Prompting LLMs offers an efficient way to guide output generation without explicit model training. In the e-commerce domain, prompt-based applications are widely used in query understanding, recommender systems, and customer support. However, adapting LLMs to different tasks often requires extensive prompt engineering by domain experts, along with frequent updates to align with evolving business needs. Additionally, crafting fully unbiased natural language prompts remains a challenge for humans. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, Examples as the Prompt (EaP). Specifically, EaP automatically selects the most representative examples to maximize the few-shot capability of LLMs. It is efficient due to its unsupervised example selection and adaptive to potential data distribution shifts. We validate EaP on four real-world production use cases, demonstrating that it achieves comparable or even superior performance comparing to hand-crafted prompts designed by domain experts. Additionally, we introduce EaP_lite, which entirely replaces the natural language components of prompts with labeled examples. EaP_lite improves LLM inference speed by up to 70% without compromising performance. The online A/B test shows that using EaP and EaP_lite for data labeling can bring significant composite revenue gain by 0.06%.',\n",

This approach significantly improves retrieval quality while maintaining low latency, ensuring a more effective and seamless search experience for customers.Our approach departs from single-vector embeddings by leveraging token-level late interaction scoring, enabling fine-grained alignment between search queries and product descriptions. To enhance search effectiveness, we introduce three key contributions: (1) large-scale synthetic query generation using LLMs to diversify training data, (2) strong negative sampling to improve contrastive learning, and (3) adaptive thresholding to dynamically refine ranking cutoffs and prevent over-retrieval biases.In live A/B testing on IKEA.com for long tail queries in the U.S. market, our system outperforms IKEA Boolean search with a 3.1% increase in click-through rate, a 1.96% boost in conversions, 1.78% increase in search interaction rate, and a 2.18% rise in add-to-cart actions.

Comprehensive offline experiments on 25 diverse emerging trends show that EBR improves ROC-AUC from 0.85 to 0.99 and PR-AUC from 0.35 to 0.95.

We thereby propose an optimized GR framework designed to alleviate retrieval hallucination, which integrates knowledge distillation reasoning in model training and incorporate decision agent to further improve retrieval precision. Specifically, we employ LLMs to assess and reason GR retrieved query-document (q-d) pairs, and then distill the reasoning data as transferred knowledge to the GR model. Moreover, we utilize a decision agent as post-processing to extend the GR retrieved documents through retrieval model and select the most relevant ones from multi perspectives as the final generative retrieval result.

Online platforms employ a range of RecSys techniques to personalize user experience across diverse in-app surfaces. User representations are often learned individually through user`s historical interactions within each surface and user representations across different surfaces can be shared post-hoc as auxiliary features or additional retrieval sources. While effective, such schemes cannot directly encode collaborative filtering signals across different surfaces, hindering its capacity to discover complex relationships between user behaviors and preferences across the whole platform. To bridge this gap at Snapchat, we seek to conduct universal user modeling (UUM) across different in-app surfaces, learning general-purpose user representations which encode behaviors across surfaces. Instead of replacing domain-specific representations, UUM representations capture cross-domain trends, enriching existing representations with complementary information.

These benchmarks provide the researchers with a corpus of documents, topics and relevance judgements indicating which documents are relevant for each topic. While test collections are an integral part of Information Retrieval (IR) research, their creation involves significant efforts in manual annotation. Large language models (LLMs) are gaining much attention as tools for automatic relevance assessment. Recent research has shown that LLM-based assessments yield high systems ranking correlation with human-made judgements. These correlations are helpful in large-scale experiments but less informative if we want to focus on top-performing systems. Moreover, these correlations ignore whether and how LLM-based judgements impact the statistically significant differences among systems with respect to human assessments. In this work, we look at how LLM-generated judgements preserve ranking differences among top-performing systems and also how they preserve pairwise significance evaluation as human judgements. Our results show that LLM-based judgements are unfair at ranking top-performing systems. Moreover, we observe an exceedingly high rate of false positives regarding statistical differences.',\n",

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have opened up new possibilities for generating human-like actions including querying, browsing, and clicking. In this work, we explore the integration of human-like thinking into search simulations by leveraging LLMs to simulate users` hidden cognitive processes. Specifically, given a search task and context, we prompt LLMs to first think like a human before executing the corresponding action. As existing search datasets do not include users` thought processes, we conducted a user study to collect a new dataset enriched with users` explicit thinking. We investigate the impact of incorporating such human-like thinking on simulation performance and apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to teach LLMs to emulate both human thinking and actions. Our experiments span two dimensions in leveraging LLMs for user simulation: (1) with or without explicit thinking, and (2) with or without fine-tuning on the thinking-augmented dataset. The results demonstrate the feasibility and potential of incorporating human-like thinking in user simulations, though performance improvements on some metrics remain modest. We believe this exploration provides new avenues and inspirations for advancing user behavior modeling in search simulations.',\n",

Concretely, in the training stage, we conduct token-wise inverse propensity score weighting to force the LLM to pay more attention on unpopular tokens. In the inference stage, we train a more biased CR model by increasing the weights of popular items, which adjusts the generation probability of corresponding tokens according to its scores for items, hoping to suppress the excessive generation of popular tokens.

In this work, we scrutinize whether this universal view fails to account for unique user behavior, thus harming realism and reliability of simulation outcomes. We conduct multiple simulations with various recommendation algorithms and choice models in the movie domain, comparing outcomes to users` organic consumption patterns. Further, we evaluate whether a holistic model that captures users` differences in behavior would better reflect a wide user base.

In response, we propose a noise-resistant Hashing Contrastive learning with hybrid selection (STAR). Specifically, STAR first develops noise-resistant hashing contrastive learning to preserve the similarity structure against label noise. In addition, we propose a hybrid sample selection strategy from the view of both Hamming distance and output uncertainty, which identifies reliable clean examples. Finally, to get rid of potential memorizing of noisy data, we incorporate both clean samples and noisy samples into selective centroid learning, which minimizes distances between clean samples and their centroids while pushing noisy samples away from negative centroids.

       "    'abstract': 'When interacting with an Information Retrieval (IR) system, users might disclose personal information, such as medical details, through their queries. Thus, assessing the level of privacy granted to users when querying an IR system is essential to determine the confidentiality of submitted sensitive data. Query obfuscation protocols have traditionally been employed to obscure a user`s real information need when retrieving documents. In these protocols, the query is modified employing ε-Differential Privacy (DP) obfuscation mechanisms, which alter query terms according to a predefined privacy budget ε. While this budget ensures formal mathematical guarantees, it provides only limited guarantees of the privacy experienced by the user and calls for empirical privacy evaluation to be carried out. Such privacy assessments employ lexical and semantic similarity measures between the original and obfuscated queries. In this study, we explore the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in privacy evaluation, simulating a scenario where users employ such models to determine whether their input has been effectively privatized. Our primary research objective is to determine whether LLMs provide a novel perspective on privacy estimation and if their assessments serve as a proxy for traditional similarity metrics, such as the Jaccard and cosine similarity derived from Transformer-based sentence embeddings. Our findings reveal a positive correlation between LLMs-generated privacy scores and cosine similarity computed using different Transformer architectures. This suggests that LLM assessments act as a proxy for similarity-based measures.',\n",

In this work, we propose a minimally supervised yet effective approach: GPT- and CLIP-powered attributes (GCAtt).

The update detection task identifies obsoleteness by comparing older and newer text versions, while the update necessity prediction task determines whether an update is required based on a given context.   To support these tasks, we curate a specialized dataset from Wikipedia called SEMUPDATES, focusing on frequently updated articles. Our experiments with five LLMs across four datasets in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned settings demonstrate that fine-tuning significantly enhances performance. In the multitask learning setup, Qwen delivers the best overall performance, while Mistral achieves the highest accuracy on individual tasks when fine-tuned separately. However, the performance differences across models are not substantial, suggesting that multiple LLMs can be effectively adapted for content update automation. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs in detecting and predicting obsolescence, providing a scalable solution for maintaining the timeliness of digital knowledge repositories.',\n",

Specifically, we have observed that the data distribution of real systems exhibits periodic drifts, leading to periodic fluctuations of prediction bias. To alleviate the above bias fluctuations while minimizing the loss of recent interests, we propose TPIA, a Training-free approach for Periodic Interest Augmentation in incremental recommendation. Specifically, after the latest model is trained, we first calculate the importance score of each model in the previous period. Then, we merge these models based on the importance scores. To minimize information loss due to interference of parameters during model merging, we further develop a method for trimming redundant and abnormal parameters. Offline experiments on both public and private datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TPIA.

       "    'abstract': 'State-of-the-art approaches for click-through rate (CTR) prediction in industry predominantly rely on transformer-based networks or their variants. However, as user behavior sequences become longer, employing self-attention networks for CTR prediction within a constrained inference time presents a significant challenge. To address this, mainstream methods adopt a classical two-stage paradigm: a General Search Unit (GSU) for quickly retrieving relevant items from long-term behaviors, and an Exact Search Unit (ESU) for applying effective Multi-Head Target Attention (MHTA) over the items selected by the GSU. These two-stage algorithms have certain limitations. Firstly, the GSU needs to retrieve different target subsequences for different target items, restricting the ESU to a suboptimal MHTA network rather than a more effective transformer-based network. Secondly, the GSU retrieves only a subset of items from the user`s behavior sequence, ignoring the evolution of user interests and the interrelationships between different points of interest. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel end-to-end hierarchical user long-term behavior modeling network for CTR prediction (HBM). Specifically, we employ the multi-interest routing layer to channel the user`s long-term behavior to several aggregated interest clusters. Furthermore, we introduce a fine interest learning network that selects the top-k interests from the initial aggregated representations. Subsequently, we employ a transformer network to model the user`s behavior sequence associated with these top-k interests in a detailed manner, while also capturing the inherent correlations between different user interests at a coarse level. Finally, we integrate the coarse and fine interests. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. In addition, an online A/B test on the JD recommendation platform shows promising improvements, with a 2.15% increase in CTR and a 0.98% increase in CVR, accompanied by lower online inference latency.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Most human languages use scripts other than the Latin alphabet. Search users in these languages often formulate their information needs in a transliterated --usually Latinized-- form for ease of typing. For example, Greek speakers might use Greeklish, and Arabic speakers might use Arabizi. This paper shows that current search systems, including those that use multilingual dense embeddings such as BGE-M3, do not generalise to this setting, and their performance rapidly deteriorates when exposed to transliterated queries. This creates a ``script gap`` between the performance of the same queries when written in their native or transliterated form. We explore whether adapting the popular ``translate-train`` paradigm to transliterations can enhance the robustness of multilingual Information Retrieval (IR) methods and bridge the gap between native and transliterated scripts. https://github.com/andreaschari/transliterations By exploring various combinations of non-Latin and Latinized query text for training, we investigate whether we can enhance the capacity of existing neural retrieval techniques and enable them to apply to this important setting. We show that by further fine-tuning IR models on an even mixture of native and Latinized text, they can perform this cross-script matching at nearly the same performance as when the query was formulated in the native script. Out-of-domain evaluation and further qualitative analysis show that transliterations can also cause queries to lose some of their nuances, motivating further research.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Learning to Rank (LTR) models learn from historical user interactions, such as user clicks. However, there is an inherent bias in the clicks of users due to position bias, i.e., users are more likely to click highly-ranked documents than low-ranked documents. To address this bias when training LTR models, many approaches from the literature re-weight the users` click data using Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS). IPS re-weights the user`s clicks proportionately to the position in the historical ranking that a document was placed when it was clicked since low-ranked documents are less likely to be seen by a user. In this paper, we argue that low-ranked documents that are similar to highly-ranked relevant documents are also likely to be relevant. Moreover, accounting for the similarity of low-ranked documents to highly ranked relevant documents when calculating IPS can more effectively mitigate the effects of position bias. Therefore, we propose an extension to IPS, called IPSsim, that takes into consideration the similarity of documents when estimating IPS. We evaluate our IPSsim estimator using two large publicly available LTR datasets under a number of simulated user click settings, and with different numbers of training clicks. Our experiments show that our IPSsim estimator is more effective than the existing IPS estimators for learning an unbiased LTR model, particularly in top-n settings when n >= 30. For example, when n = 50, our IPSsim estimator achieves a statistically significant ~3% improvement (p < 0.05) in terms of NDCG compared to the Doubly Robust estimator from the literature.',\n",

Just as a user selects a relevant document from a ranked list of retrieved ones, a software generation workflow requires a developer to choose (and potentially refine) a generated solution from a ranked list of alternative solutions, ordered by their posterior likelihoods. This implies that estimating the quality of a ranked list -- akin to estimating ``relevance`` for query performance prediction (QPP) in IR -- is also crucial for generative software development, where quality is defined in terms of ``functional correctness``. In this paper, we propose an in-context learning (ICL) based approachfor code quality estimation. Our findings demonstrate that providing few-shot examples of functionally correct code from a training set enhances the performance of existing QPP approaches as well as a zero-shot-based approach for code quality estimation.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) is an effective IR approach that exploits pre-trained language models for encoding text into a learned bag of words. Several efforts in the literature have shown that sparsity is key to enabling a good trade-off between the efficiency and effectiveness of the query processor. To induce the right degree of sparsity, researchers typically use regularization techniques when training LSR models. Recently, new efficient—inverted index-based—retrieval engines have been proposed, leading to a natural question: has the role of regularization changed in training LSR models? In this paper, we conduct an extended evaluation of regularization approaches for LSR where we discuss their effectiveness, efficiency, and out-of-domain generalization capabilities. We first show that regularization can be relaxed to produce more effective LSR en- coders. We also show that query encoding is now the bottleneck limiting the overall query processor performance. To remove this bottleneck, we advance the state-of-the-art of inference-free LSR by proposing Learned Inference-free Retrieval (Li-Lsr). At training time, Li-Lsr learns a score for each token, casting the query encoding step into a seamless table lookup. Our approach yields state-of-the-art effectiveness for both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluation,surpassing Splade-v3-Doc by 1 point of mRR@10 on MsMarco and 1.8 points of nDCG@10 on Beir.',\n",

Previously, user intents were classified manually and automatically; the latter helped to avoid hand labelling of large datasets. Recent studies explored whether LLMs can reliably determine user intent. However, researchers have recognized the limitations of using generative LLMs for classification tasks. In this study, we empirically compare user intent classification into informational, navigational, and transactional categories, using weak supervision and LLMs. Specifically, we evaluate LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct and LLaMA-3.1-70B-Instruct for in-context learning and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct for fine-tuning, comparing their performance to an established baseline classifier trained using weak supervision (ORCAS-I). Our results indicate that while LLMs outperform weak supervision in recall, they continue to struggle with precision, which shows the need for improved methods to balance both metrics effectively.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Entity linking (EL) aligns textual mentions with their corresponding entities in a knowledge base, facilitating various applications such as semantic search and question answering. Recent advances in multimodal entity linking (MEL) have shown that combining text and images can reduce ambiguity and improve alignment accuracy. However, most existing MEL methods overlook the rich structural information available in the form of knowledge-graph (KG) triples. In this paper, we propose KGMEL, a novel framework that leverages KG triples to enhance MEL. Specifically, it operates in three stages: (1) Generation: Produces high-quality triples for each mention by employing vision-language models based on its text and images. (2) Retrieval: Learns joint mention-entity representations, via contrastive learning, that integrate text, images, and (generated or KG) triples to retrieve candidate entities for each mention. (3) Reranking: Refines the KG triples of the candidate entities and employs large language models to identify the best-matching entity for the mention. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that KGMEL outperforms existing methods. Our code, datasets, and online appendix are available at: https://github.com/juyeonnn/KGMEL.',\n",

Current machine learning approaches can reliably detect sexism based on standardized definitions, but often neglect the subjective nature of sexist language and fail to consider individual users` perspectives. To address this gap, we adopt a perspectivist approach, retaining diverse annotations rather than enforcing gold-standard labels or their aggregations, allowing models to account for personal or group-specific views of sexism. Using demographic data from Twitter, we employ large language models (LLMs) to personalize the identification of sexism.  Our empirical results show that OpenAI`s LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and GPT-4o) and two open-source LLMs (Mistral and Qwen) exhibit higher Krippendorff`s alpha label agreement with female annotators than with male annotators. As well, each LLM presents higher Krippendorff`s alpha agreement with a specific annotator age group. We then sought to counter these trends by providing ``persona`` instructions as part of the LLM prompt, with somewhat surprising outcomes, highlighting the potential of user-centered perspectivist methods to improve content moderation systems.',\n",

We propose a novel evaluation framework that extends IR fairness metrics by incorporating centrality-based measures to account for influence of retrieved documents on generated output beyond ranking. Our framework evaluates RAG systems across various cognitive dimensions using two ranking approaches: lexical (BM25) and dense (BGE), and language models of varying sizes.

We devise hierarchical modules to align with real-world user recharge behaviors, and a Zero-Inflated Mixture-of-Logistic (ZIMoL) loss instead of a unimodal distribution loss is adopted to better model various segments of users.We also introduce a calibration module that enables more robust predictions for new users.Both offline evaluation on real-world industrial datasets over state-of-the-art baselines and online A/B test from a leading game platform demonstrate the superior performance of our method.',\n",

Existing approaches strike efficiency and effectiveness through a two-stage paradigm: first retrieving hundreds of candidate-related items and then extracting interest intensity vector through target attention. However, we argue that the discrepancy in target attention`s relevance distribution between the retrieved items and the full long behavior sequence inevitably leads to a performance decline. To alleviate the discrepancy, we propose the Deep Multiple Quantization Network (DMQN) to process long behavior sequence end-to-end through compressing the long behavior sequence. Firstly, the entire spectrum of long behavior sequence will be quantized into multiple codeword sequences based on multiple independent codebooks. Hierarchical Sequential Transduction Unit is incorporated to facilitate the interaction of reduced codeword sequences. Then, attention between the candidate and multiple codeword sequences will output the interest vector. To enable online serving, intermediate representations of the codeword sequences are cached, significantly reducing latency. Our extensive experiments on both industrial and public datasets confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of DMQN. The A/B test in our advertising system shows that DMQN improves CTR by 3.5\\\\% and RPM by 2.0\\\\%.',\n",

The complexity of fairness and IR systems makes it challenging to provide a systematic summary of the progress that has been made. This complexity calls for a more structured framework to navigate future fairness-aware IR research directions. The field of economics has long explored fairness, offering a strong theoretical and empirical foundation. Its system-oriented perspective enables the integration of IR fairness into a broader framework that considers societal and intertemporal trade-offs. In this tutorial, we first highlight that IR systems can be understood as a specialized economic market. Then, we re-organize fairness algorithms through three key economic dimensions—macro vs. micro, demand vs supply, and short-term vs. long-term. We effectively view most fairness categories in IR from an economic perspective. Finally, we illustrate how this economic framework can be applied to various real-world IR applications and we demonstrate its benefits in industrial scenarios.

       "    'abstract': 'Retrieval-Enhanced Machine Learning (REML) refers to the use of information retrieval (IR) methods to support reasoning and inference in machine learning tasks. Although relatively recent, these approaches can substantially improve model performance. This includes improved generalization, knowledge grounding, scalability, freshness, attribution, interpretability, and on-device learning. To date, despite being influenced by work in the information retrieval community, REML research has predominantly been presented in natural language processing (NLP) conferences. Our tutorial addresses this disconnect by introducing core REML concepts and synthesizing the literature from various domains in machine learning (ML), including, but not limited to, NLP. What is unique to our approach is the use of consistent notations to provide researchers with a unified and expandable framework. The tutorial will be presented in lecture format based on an existing manuscript, with supporting materials and a comprehensive reading list available at a website. Building on the momentum of our successful workshop at SIGIR 2023 and our tutorial at SIGIR-AP 2024, this year`s tutorial features updated content with an emphasis on retrieval technologies used across the broader ML community. We also highlight their role in emerging, future-facing applications such as language agents and evolving scenarios where the extensive body of knowledge from IR can provide critical insights and capabilities.',\n",

They facilitate patent landscape analysis, help in the drafting and evaluation tasks in the patenting process, and enable efficient information extraction to gain practical insights into new technologies and innovations. Moreover, they assist in identifying existing solutions, knowledge gaps, trends, and persistent challenges within specific technological fields, thereby informing strategic decision-making and innovation management.Advances in machine learning and natural language processing allow to further automate such tasks, e.g. paragraph retrieval, question answering (QA) or patent text generation. The exploration of semantic technologies for the intellectual property (IP) industry is still in its early stages, with significant potential yet to be unlocked. Investigating the use of artificial intelligence (AI) methods for the patent domain is therefore not only of academic interest, but also highly relevant for practitioners. Compared to other domains, high quality, semi-structured, annotated data is available in large volumes (a requirement for supervised machine learning models), making training large models easier. On the other hand, domain-specific challenges arise, such as very technical language or legal requirements for patent documents, and data from various disciplines and technological areas. With the 6th edition of this workshop we will provide a platform for researchers and industry to discuss recent developments for semantic patent retrieval and analysis employing sophisticated methods ranging from patent text mining, domain-specific information retrieval to large language models (LLMs) targeting next generation applications and use cases for the IP and related domains.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'In the Web ecosystem, document authors often strategically modify content to maximize visibility in search rankings. These ranking-incentivized modifications pose challenges to retrieval effectiveness, content diversity, and long-term stability. At the same time, the rise of large language models (LLMs) is transforming IR: queries and documents that were once assumed to be generated exclusively by humans can now also be created by automated agents [5]. These agents can  formulate queries, generate documents, and perform ranking. This introduces a variety of new challenges and opportunities in competitive search environments, where interactions between strategic agents can substantially influence outcomes. This research pursues two primary goals. First, it seeks to understand strategic interactions, particularly how different configurations of users (query), authors (document) and systems (ranker) influence competition outcomes. Second, it explores methods for designing systems that foster beneficial outcomes, such as stability and fairness.  To this end, this research employs a combination of game-theoretic analysis, empirical ranking competitions between humans, and simulation-based experiments to investigate competitive dynamics in information retrieval systems [1-4]. Our theoretical analysis begins by modeling settings where authors compete to promote their documents across multiple queries as a continuous game in which each author allocates emphasis across different queries. We fully characterize when pure Nash equilibria exist and show that, unlike single-query settings, a stable state almost never exists [4]. To address this instability, we propose a novel method of strategic corpus enrichment. Specifically, we show using theoretical analysis how the mediator, by strategically planting documents in the corpus, can achieve stability in the system [2].',\n",

       "    'title': 'Enhancing AI Agents with Human Theory of Mind (ToM) for Context-Aware Actions',\n",
       "    'abstract': 'In the domain of artificial intelligence, the role of agents is rapidly expanding. An agent is an autonomous entity that perceives its environment, makes informed decisions, and takes actions to complete tasks. However, enabling agents to accurately interpret and respond to human requests—particularly through understanding human Theory of Mind (ToM)—remains a complex and pivotal challenge. ToM encompasses the ability to recognize that individuals possess distinct mental states, such as intentions, beliefs, and desires, which may differ from one`s own. This cognitive faculty is fundamental to human interaction, enabling empathy and understanding across diverse contexts. As AI agents are increasingly deployed across new domains, approximating ToM becomes vital for producing appropriate and context-sensitive responses. Recent studies have explored methodologies to enhance ToM capabilities in large language models (LLMs), aiming to refine their ability to infer and track human mental states. By leveraging ToM, LLMs have been shown to approximate key aspects of human-like social cognition. However, most existing research has focused primarily on evaluating ToM within LLMs, overlooking the broader challenge of enabling AI agents to actively understand and respond to human cognitive and mental states. While previous studies have developed agents focused on extracting human mental states, further research is needed to design agents capable of performing diverse tasks while integrating ToM reasoning. AI agents must not only infer mental states but also leverage them to enhance reasoning, planning, decision-making, and task execution. For example, an educational tutor agent assisting a student with a math problem must recognize whether the student seeks step-by-step guidance or conceptual clarification, and whether their broader intent is to master the material or to prepare for an exam. Without accurately inferring and leveraging such mental states, agents risk producing ineffective interactions, leading to user frustration and disengagement. Incorporating ToM information is therefore crucial for improving decision-making and enabling more contextually appropriate responses.  To address this gap,ToM capabilities must be incorporated into AI agents by modeling core mental states such as Belief, Desire, and Intention (BDI). Building on BDI as a structured foundation for representing human cognition, ToM-Act is proposed as a framework to enhance agent decision-making and action-taking through ToM-informed reasoning. This motivation stems from the increasing deployment of AI agents, highlighting the need for methods that optimize their decision-making.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Conversational information seeking (CIS) systems aim to understand a user`s evolving information needs in the context of a conversation and respond effectively. These systems are especially valuable for users who may struggle with traditional interfaces, offering a more natural and accessible mode of interaction. To ensure the groundedness and accuracy of responses, existing methods break the task into several subtasks, namely, dialogue context modeling, retrieval, and answer generation. The user`s information need is often represented by either a single rewritten query or a single representation in the query embedding space. This leads to several limitations, especially in cases where the information need cannot be answered using a single passage and requires complex reasoning over multiple facts from different sources. We address this limitation by proposing the MQ4CS model, which breaks the information need of the user into multiple queries with different aspects. In MQ4CS, the retrieval is done for each query and rank list fusion is done over the list of documents retrieved for each query.  Evaluation of responses generated by Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems remains an open problem. The quality of the response is mainly assessed using surface-based QA metrics, human evaluation, or instructing the Large Language Models (LLMs). Since RAG-generated responses integrate both retrieved documents and the LLMs`s internal knowledge, traditional surface-based QA metrics are not effective for assessment. Furthermore, existing RAG benchmarks address more complex information needs compared to ad-hoc retrieval and QA, highlighting the necessity of measuring the completeness of generated responses. To better evaluate completeness and correctness, we propose a nugget-based evaluation pipeline called CONE-RAG that measures the precision and recall of key information nuggets in generated answers.  Personalization is an emerging key challenge in Conversational Search (CS). A personalized CS system must adapt its response based on the user`s personal information and search history. Given the same user question, the response of a personalized CS system must be different for different users. To facilitate the research on the development and evaluation of personalized CS systems, I have co-organized the iKAT track at TREC, where we released the iKAT 2023 and 2024 datasets.',\n",

Modern search systems use a combination of candidate generation and ranking approaches, with advanced methods leveraging deep learning and LLM-based techniques to retrieve, generate, and categorize search results.

Such issues can misalign with product goals and user expectations, potentially harming user trust and business outcomes.

       "    'abstract': 'Online community platforms require dynamic personalized retrieval and recommendation that can continuously adapt to evolving user interests and new documents. However, optimizing models to handle such changes in real-time remains a major challenge in large-scale industrial settings. To address this, we propose the Interest-aware Representation and Alignment (IRA) framework, an efficient and scalable approach that dynamically adapts to new interactions through a cumulative structure. IRA leverages two key mechanisms: (1) Interest Units that capture diverse user interests as contextual texts, while reinforcing or fading over time through cumulative updates, and (2) a retrieval process that measures the relevance between Interest Units and documents based solely on semantic relationships, eliminating dependence on click signals to mitigate temporal biases. By integrating cumulative Interest Unit updates with the retrieval process, IRA continuously adapts to evolving user preferences, ensuring robust and fine-grained personalization without being constrained by past training distributions. We validate the effectiveness of IRA through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, including its deployment in the Home Section of NAVER`s CAFE, South Korea`s leading community platform.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Legal retrieval is a widely studied area in Information Retrieval (IR) and a key task in this domain is retrieving relevant cases based on a given query case, often done by applying language models as encoders to model case similarity. Recently, Tang et al. proposed CaseLink, a novel graph-based method for legal case retrieval, which models both cases and legal charges as nodes in a network, with edges representing relationships such as references and shared semantics. This approach offers a new perspective on the task by capturing higher-order relationships of cases going beyond the stand-alone level of documents. However, while this shift in approaching legal case retrieval is a promising direction in an understudied area of graph-based legal IR, challenges in reproducing novel results have recently been highlighted, with multiple studies reporting difficulties in reproducing previous findings. Thus, in this work we reproduce CaseLink, a graph-based legal case retrieval method, to support future research in this area of IR. In particular, we aim to assess its reliability and generalizability by (i) first reproducing the original study setup and (ii) applying the approach to an additional dataset. We then build upon the original implementations by (iii) evaluating the approach`s performance when using a more sophisticated graph data representation and (iv) using an open large language model (LLM) in the pipeline to address limitations that are known to result from using closed models accessed via an API. Our findings aim to improve the understanding of graph-based approaches in legal IR and contribute to improving reproducibility in the field. To achieve this, we share all our implementations and experimental artifacts with the community.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Image-Text Retrieval (ITR) systems are central to multimodal information access, with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) showing strong performance on standard benchmarks. However, these benchmarks predominantly rely on coarse-grained annotations, limiting their ability to reveal how models would perform under real-world conditions, where query granularity varies.  Motivated by this gap, we examine how dataset granularity and query perturbations affect retrieval performance and robustness across four architecturally diverse VLMs (ALIGN, AltCLIP, CLIP, and GroupViT).  Using both standard benchmarks (MS-COCO, Flickr30k) and their fine-grained variants, we show that richer captions consistently enhance retrieval, especially in text-to-image tasks, where we observe an average improvement of 16.23%, compared to 6.44% in image-to-text.  To assess robustness, we introduce a taxonomy of perturbations and conduct extensive experiments, revealing that while perturbations typically degrade performance, they can also unexpectedly improve retrieval, exposing nuanced model behaviors. Notably, word order emerges as a critical factor -- contradicting prior assumptions of model insensitivity to it.  Our results highlight variation in model robustness and a dataset-dependent relationship between caption granularity and perturbation sensitivity and emphasize the necessity of evaluating models on datasets of varying granularity.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Multimodal embedding models have been widely adopted in text-to-image retrieval, enabling direct comparison between text and image modalities. However, how well they handle long text is poorly understood. For instance, Long-CLIP found that OpenAI`s CLIP model, despite having a 77-token input limit, maintains optimal performance for only 20 tokens- its effective token length. In this paper, we build on the Long-CLIP study, and extend the analysis to other widely used multimodal models and find their effective token length. Unlike Long-CLIP, we examine how domain-specific language influences changes in effective token length and explore its implications on different domains. Based on our findings, we create a comprehensive reference of various models` effective token length across different domains; offering deeper insights into the true limitations of multimodal models used in text-to-image retrieval. Finally, we introduce a systematic benchmark that determines the effective token length of any multimodal model using a given dataset. Our results show that the effective token length is consistently lower than the input token limit for all models, meaning that these models cannot utilize all the text that can be given to them. We also find that the effective token length varies by dataset, with domain-specific language influencing how much text a model can use before retrieval performance plateaus.

We propose ADORE, a self-sustaining framework that synergizes three innovations: (1) A Rule-aware Relevance Discrimination module, where a Chain-of-Thought LLM generates intent-aligned training data, refined via Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) to align with user behavior; (2) An Error-type-aware Data Synthesis module that auto-generates adversarial examples to harden robustness; and (3) A Key-attribute-enhanced Knowledge Distillation module that injects domain-specific attribute hierarchies into a deployable student model. ADORE automates annotation, adversarial generation, and distillation, overcoming data scarcity while enhancing reasoning. Large-scale experiments and online A/B testing verify the effectiveness of ADORE. The framework establishes a new paradigm for resource-efficient, cognitively aligned relevance modeling in industrial applications.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The rapid growth of online shopping stores, such as Amazon, has led to services reaching billions of people worldwide. With global retail sales exceeding $6 trillion in 2024, customer expectations for personalized and seamless shopping experiences have heightened. Traditional online shopping experiences, such as search and navigation systems, often fall short in addressing complex shopping journeys. Conversational shopping (such as Amazon Rufus) offers a transformative approach by enabling dynamic, multi-turn dialogues that closely resemble human interactions. This allows customers to explore product options, seek clarifications, and receive personalized recommendations, thereby enhancing product discovery and informed decision-making. In this paper, we share our year-long journey of using language models for conversational shopping at Amazon and introduce how we use LLM fine-tuning techniques to enhance LLMs for a conversational shopping experience like Amazon Rufus. We also introduce innovative strategies for training data collection and demonstrate real-world applications, including product recommendations, clarification mechanisms, and internationalization for global customers.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'E-commerce recommendation systems aim to generate ordered lists of items for customers, optimizing multiple business objectives, such as clicks, conversions and Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV). Traditional multi-objective optimization methods like formulas or Learning-to-rank (LTR) models take effect at item-level, neglecting dynamic user intent and contextual item interactions. List-level multi-objective optimization in the re-ranking stage can overcome this limitation, but most current re-ranking models focus more on accuracy improvement with context. In addition, re-ranking is faced with the challenges of time complexity and diversity. In light of this, we propose a novel end-to-end generative re-ranking model named Sequential Ordered Regression Transformer-Generator (SORT-Gen) for the less-studied list-level multi-objective optimization problem. Specifically, SORT-Gen is divided into two parts: 1)Sequential Ordered Regression Transformer innovatively uses Transformer and ordered regression to accurately estimate multi-objective values for variable-length sub-lists. 2)Mask-Driven Fast Generation Algorithm combines multi-objective candidate queues, efficient item selection and diversity mechanism into model inference, providing a fast online list generation method. Comprehensive online experiments demonstrate that SORT-Gen brings +4.13% CLCK and +8.10% GMV for Baiyibutie, a notable Mini-app of Taobao. Currently, SORT-Gen has been successfully deployed in multiple scenarios of Taobao App, serving for a vast number of users.',\n",

Our proposed SuperRS framework employs a Dual-layer Multi-MoE (DualMoE) architecture to tackle scenario-specific disparities and achieve multi-interest fusion perception. A key aspect is the Search-Recommendation Sequence Fusion Unit, which integrates user interaction sequences from both scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a unified Representation Extraction method utilizing Reciprocal Scenario Interest Attention (RSIA) for feature alignment. Dynamic Feature Integration (DFI) employs a dual gating mechanism for controlled information fusion while preserving scenario identities, combined with multi-objective optimization.

There are very few interaction datasets on recommenders with carousel interfaces and none that contain gaze data.We introduce the RecGaze dataset: the first comprehensive feedback dataset on carousels that includes eye tracking results, clicks, cursor movements, and selection explanations.

       "    'abstract': 'Transformer-based text-image matching model, known as CLIP, has garnered significant attention owing to its exceptional performance in text-image retrieval tasks and downstream applications. However, the interpret-ability of CLIP remains underexplored. Existing interpretation methods for Transformers often struggle with incomplete and unreliable attributions within the image and text modalities, respectively. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained interpretation method, termed Class Activation Values (CAV), to provide lucid and faithful visual explanations for CLIP-based text-image retrievals. Specifically, we systematically perform multi-scale accumulation and fusion of class-specific gradients and activation value features to generate high-definition explanations for the image encoder. Furthermore, we present element-wise gradient-based weights to attribute fine-grained relevance between value features and output similarity within the text encoder. The proposed CAV is capable of simultaneously rendering detailed and credible explanations due to its precise feature attribution. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments are conducted on the ImageNet-1k and MS COCO datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that CAV outperforms state-of-the-art interpretation methods in both faithfulness and localization assessments across image and text modalities.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Instant messaging with texts and stickers has become a widely adopted communication medium, enabling efficient expression of user semantics and emotions. With the increased use of stickers conveying information and feelings, sticker retrieval and recommendation has emerged as an important area of research. However, a major limitation in existing literature has been the lack of datasets capturing temporal and user-specific sticker interactions, which has hindered further progress in user modeling and sticker personalization. To address this, we introduce User-Sticker, a dataset that includes temporal and user anonymous ID across conversations. It is the largest publicly available sticker dataset to date, containing 22K unique users, 370K stickers, and 8.3M messages. The raw data was collected from a popular messaging platform from 67 conversations over 720 hours of crawling. All text and image data were carefully vetted for safety and privacy checks and modifications. Spanning 10 domains, the U-Sticker dataset captures rich temporal, multilingual, and cross-domain behaviors not previously available in other datasets. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate U-Sticker’s practical applications in user behavior modeling and personalized recommendation and highlight its potential to further research areas in personalized retrieval and conversational studies. U-Sticker dataset is publicly available.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Tourism Recommender Systems (TRS) are crucial in personalizing travel experiences by tailoring recommendations to users` preferences, constraints, and contextual factors. However, publicly available travel datasets often lack sufficient breadth and depth, limiting their ability to support advanced personalization strategies --- particularly for sustainable travel and off-peak tourism. In this work, we explore using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic travel queries that emulate diverse user personas and incorporate structured filters such as budget constraints and sustainability preferences.    This paper introduces a novel SynthTRIPs framework for generating synthetic travel queries using LLMs grounded in a curated knowledge base (KB). Our approach combines persona-based preferences (e.g., budget, travel style) with explicit sustainability filters (e.g., walkability, air quality) to produce realistic and diverse queries. We mitigate hallucination and ensure factual correctness by grounding the LLM responses in the KB. We formalize the query generation process and introduce evaluation metrics for assessing realism and alignment. Both human expert evaluations and automatic LLM-based assessments demonstrate the effectiveness of our synthetic dataset in capturing complex personalization aspects underrepresented in existing datasets. While our framework was developed and tested for personalized city trip recommendations, the methodology applies to other recommender system domains.Code and dataset are made public at https://bit.ly/synthTRIPs',\n",

To address this, we introduce the Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Generation (MRAMG) task, in which we aim to generate multimodal answers that combine both text and images, fully leveraging the multimodal data within a corpus. Despite growing attention to this challenging task, a notable lack of a comprehensive benchmark persists for effectively evaluating its performance. To bridge this gap, we provide MRAMG-Bench, a meticulously curated, human-annotated benchmark comprising 4,346 documents, 14,190 images, and 4,800 QA pairs, distributed across six distinct datasets and spanning three domains: Web, Academia, and Lifestyle. The datasets incorporate diverse difficulty levels and complex multi-image scenarios, providing a robust foundation for evaluating the MRAMG task. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, MRAMG-Bench incorporates a comprehensive suite of both statistical and LLM-based metrics, enabling a thorough analysis of the performance of generative models in the MRAMG task. Additionally, we propose an efficient and flexible multimodal answer generation framework that can leverage LLMs/MLLMs to generate multimodal responses.

In particular, recent studies have shown that current ATS metrics do not correlate with the presence of errors. Manual inspections have further revealed a variety of errors, underscoring the need for a more nuanced evaluation framework, which is currently lacking. This resource paper addresses this gap by introducing a test collection for detecting and classifying errors in simplified texts. First, we propose a taxonomy of errors, with a formal focus on information distortion. Next, we introduce a parallel dataset of automatically simplified scientific texts. This dataset has been human-annotated with labels based on our proposed taxonomy. Finally, we analyze the quality of the dataset, and we study the performance of existing models to detect and classify errors from that taxonomy.

Machine learning-based assistants demonstrate a strong ability for language understanding but are expensive to train.

       "    'abstract': 'Traditional Information Retrieval (IR) effectiveness metrics assume that a relevant document satisfies the information need as a whole. Nevertheless, if the information need is faceted or contains subtopics, this notion of relevance cannot model documents relevant only to one or a few subtopics. Furthermore, faceted documents in a ranked list may focus on the same subtopics, and their content may overlap while neglecting other subtopics. Hence, a search result, where topranked documents deal with different subtopics should be preferred over a result where documents are thematically limited and provide overlapping information. The Multi-Dimensional Cumulated Utility (MDCU) metric, recently formulated theoretically by Järvelin and Sormunen, extends the evaluation of novelty and diversity by considering content overlapping among documents. While Järvelin and Sormunen described the theory of MDCU and illustrated its application on a toy example, they did not investigate its empirical use. In this paper, we show the practical feasibility and validity of the MDCU by applying it to publicly available TREC test collections. Furthermore, we analyse its relation with the well-established α-nDCG, and finally, we provide a Python implementation of the MDCU, fostering its adoption as an evaluation framework. Our results indicate a positive correlation between α-nDCG and MDCU, suggesting that both measures correctly identify similar trends when evaluating the IR systems. Finally, compared to α-nDCG, MDCU exhibits a stronger statistical power and identifies up to 9 times more statistically significantly different pairs of systems.',\n",

As the number of dialogue turns increases and the conversation content becomes more complex, existing methods that simply incorporate conversational context are insufficient to effectively capture the nuanced information necessary for accurate stance detection. To address this issue, we introduce a Multi-agent Reasoning Graph Knowledge Distillation (MRGKD) framework, leveraging conversational reasoning among multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) into smaller language models. Specifically, we first construct a multi-agent reasoning graph to infer implicit logical relationships within the conversational history from the diverse perspectives of multiple LLMs. To fully leverage the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs, we design a reasoning knowledge editing mechanism that internalizes new information by aligning the output distribution of smaller language models with both the conversational history and the knowledge derived from the multi-agent reasoning graph. Additionally, we incorporate a contrastive loss to distinguish between correct and incorrect reasoning, alongside a stance detection loss, to fine-tune the smaller language models. This approach not only ensures the accurate acquisition of logical knowledge but also preserves the integrity of the conversational history.

We posit that reranking the retrieved context to enhance topical diversity can improve downstream task performance. To achieve this, we leverage maximum marginal relevance (MMR) which balances topical similarity with inter-example diversity.

One state-of-the-art technique, activation patching, has been applied to analyzing neural ranker behavior in relation to information retrieval (IR) axioms. To date, however, this remains a rapidly evolving topic in IR, with no established methodology for measuring results or constructing datasets to ensure pronounced, robust, and consistent patching effects. In this study, based on experimental results, we provide recommendations on measuring patching effects and designing diagnostic datasets for investigating term frequency. We identify the rareness and informativeness of injected terms as a key factor influencing the magnitude of patching effects. Additionally, we find that low score differences between baseline and perturbed documents introduce significant noise, which can be mitigated by filtering or applying penalty scores to the metric. More generally, we provide practical recommendations for the reliable application of activation patching in IR, advancing future interpretability research of neural ranking models.

       "    'abstract': 'Audio-language retrieval faces a fundamental challenge due to many-to-one mappings, where multiple audio instances correspond to the same or similar textual descriptions. This ambiguity leads to overlapping representations, making it difficult for models to learn discriminative features between samples. Queue-based contrastive learning helps mitigate this ambiguity by maintaining a large pool of negatives, improving retrieval performance. However, selecting appropriate hyperparameters, such as the queue size for optimal performance and the number of epochs to prevent overfitting, remains a challenge. In this study, we propose a LAtent Space Embedding Rank (LASER) analysis. Specifically, we analyze that a low-rank property of a queue indicates the presence of informative negative samples, and demonstrate that the best performance is achieved when the queue has the lowest rank. Furthermore, the convergence of rank variation can be interpreted as the model parameters reaching an optimal state during training. Thanks to the proposed rank-based analysis, the model hyperparameters can be selected analytically rather than through trial and error. Experimental results confirm that retrieval performance depends on queue rank, with lower ranks yielding better performance. These findings suggest that our LASER analysis can provide insight into how rank-based analysis can improve retrieval performance in audio-language tasks.',\n",

This study focuses on LLM-generated usefulness labels, a crucial evaluation metric that considers the user`s search intents and task objectives, an aspect where relevance falls short. Our experiment utilizes task-level, query-level, and document-level features along with user search behavior signals, which are essential in defining the usefulness of a document. Our research finds that (i) pre-trained LLMs can generate moderate usefulness labels by understanding the comprehensive search task session, and (ii) pre-trained LLMs perform better judgment in short search sessions when provided with search session contexts. Furthermore, we investigate whether LLMs can capture the unique divergence between relevance and usefulness, along with conducting an ablation study to identify the most critical metrics for accurate usefulness label generation. In conclusion, this work explores LLM-generated usefulness labels by evaluating critical metrics and optimizing for practicality in real-world settings.',\n",

Classical representation methods integrate item features using concatenation or neural networks to generate homogeneous representation sequences. While straightforward, these methods overlook the heterogeneity of item features, limiting the transformer`s ability to capture fine-grained patterns and restricting scalability. Recent studies have attempted to integrate user-side heterogeneous features into item representation sequences, but item-side heterogeneous features, which are vital for performance, remain excluded. To address these challenges, we propose a Heterogeneous Information Transformer model for Sequential Recommendation (HeterRec), which incorporates Heterogeneous Token Flatten Layer (HTFL) and Hierarchical Causal Transformer Layer (HCT). Our HTFL is a novel item tokenization method that converts items into a heterogeneous token set and organizes these tokens into heterogeneous sequences, effectively enhancing performance gains when scaling up the model. Moreover, HCT introduces token-level and item-level causal transformers to extract fine-grained patterns from the heterogeneous sequences.

However, traditional search methods often struggle to balance the need for localized precision with the broader context required for holistic understanding, leaving critical facets of intricate queries underexplored. In this paper, we introduce an LLM-based search assistant that adopts a new information seeking paradigm with holistically guided Monte Carlo tree search (HG-MCTS). We reformulate the task as a progressive information collection process with a knowledge memory and unite an adaptive checklist with multi-perspective reward modeling in MCTS. The adaptive checklist provides explicit sub-goals to guide the MCTS process toward comprehensive coverage of complex user queries. Simultaneously, our multi-perspective reward modeling offers both exploration and retrieval rewards, along with progress feedback that tracks completed and remaining sub-goals, refining the checklist as the tree search progresses. By striking a balance between localized tree expansion and global guidance, HG-MCTS reduces redundancy in search paths and ensures that all crucial aspects of an intricate query are properly addressed. Extensive experiments on real-world intricate information seeking tasks demonstrate that HG-MCTS acquires thorough knowledge collections and delivers more accurate final responses compared with existing baselines.',\n",

Our extensive experiments on subsets of the MS MARCO and TREC-DL test sets show that data augmentation, along with the ranking-adapted contrastive losses, results in performance improvements under most dataset sizes.

However, these fine-grained representations may cause unacceptable storage overhead for practical search systems.

       "    'abstract': 'Recommender systems play a crucial role in personalizing user experiences, yet ensuring fairness in their outcomes remains an elusive challenge. This work explores the impact of individual users or items on the fairness of recommender systems, thus addressing a significant knowledge gap in the field. We introduce an innovative approach called Adding-Based Counterfactual Fairness Reasoning (ACFR), designed to elucidate recommendation fairness from the unique perspectives of users and items. Conventional methodologies, like erasing-based counterfactual analysis, pose limitations, particularly in modern recommender systems dealing with a large number of users and items. These traditional methods, by excluding specific users or items, risk disrupting the crucial relational structure central to collaborative filtering recommendations. In contrast, ACFR employs an adding-based counterfactual analysis, a unique strategy allowing us to consider potential, yet-to-happen user-item interactions. This strategy preserves the core user-item relational structure, while predicting future behaviors of users or items. The commonly used feature-based counterfactual analysis, relying on gradient-based optimization to identify interference on each feature, is not directly applicable in our case. In the recommendation scenario we consider, only interactions between users and items are present during model training—no distinct features are involved. Consequently, the traditional mechanism proves impractical for identifying interference on these existing interactions. Our extensive experiments validate the superiority of ACFR over traditional baseline methods, demonstrating significant improvements in recommendation fairness on benchmark datasets. This work, therefore, provides a fresh perspective and a promising methodology for enhancing fairness in recommender systems.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Multi-stakeholder recommender systems involve various roles, such as users and providers. Previous work pointed out that max-min fairness (MMF) is a better metric to support weak providers. However, when considering MMF, the features or parameters of these roles vary over time, and how to ensure long-term provider MMF has become a significant challenge. We observed that recommendation feedback loops (RFL) will influence the provider MMF greatly in the long term. RFL means that recommender systems can only receive feedback on exposed items from users and update recommender models incrementally based on this feedback. When utilizing the feedback, the recommender model will regard the unexposed items as negative. In this way, the tail provider will not get the opportunity to be exposed, and its items will always be considered negative samples. Such phenomena will become more and more serious in RFL. To alleviate the problem, this article proposes an online ranking model named Long-Term Provider Max-min Fairness (LTP-MMF). Theoretical analysis shows that the long-term regret of LTP-MMF enjoys a sub-linear bound. Experimental results on three public recommendation benchmarks demonstrated that LTP-MMF can outperform the baselines in the long term.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Sequential recommendation aims to recommend the next items that a target user may have interest in based on the user’s sequence of past behaviors, which has become a hot research topic in both academia and industry. In the literature, sequential recommendation adopts a Sequence-to-Item or Sequence-to-Sequence training strategy, which supervises a sequential model with a user’s next one or more behaviors as the labels and the sequence of the past behaviors as the input. However, existing powerful sequential recommendation approaches employ more and more complex deep structures such as Transformer in order to accurately capture the sequential patterns, which heavily rely on hand-crafted designs on key attention mechanism to achieve state-of-the-art performance, thus failing to automatically obtain the optimal design of attention representation architectures in various scenarios with different data. Other works on classic automated deep recommender systems only focus on traditional settings, ignoring the problem of sequential scenarios. In this article, we study the problem of automated sequential recommendation, which faces two main challenges: (1) How can we design a proper search space tailored for attention automation in sequential recommendation, and (2) How can we accurately search effective attention representation architectures considering multiple user interests reflected in the sequential behavior. To tackle these challenges, we propose an automated disentangled sequential recommendation (AutoDisenSeq) model. In particular, we employ neural architecture search (NAS) and design a search space tailored for automated attention representation in attentive intention-disentangled sequential recommendation with an expressive and efficient space complexity of O(n^2) given as the number of layers. We further propose a context-aware parameter sharing mechanism taking characteristics of each sub-architecture into account to enable accurate architecture performance estimations and great flexibility for disentanglement of latent intention representation. Moreover, we propose AutoDisenSeq-large language model (LLM), which utilizes the textual understanding power of LLM as a guidance to refine the candidate list for recommendation from AutoDisenSeq. We conduct extensive experiments to show that our proposed AutoDisenSeq model and AutoDisenSeq-LLM model outperform existing baseline methods on four real-world datasets in both overall recommendation and cold-start recommendation scenarios.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Neural ranking models (NRMs) have demonstrated effective performance in several information retrieval (IR) tasks. However, training NRMs often requires large-scale training data, which is difficult and expensive to obtain. To address this issue, one can train NRMs via weak supervision, where a large dataset is automatically generated using an existing ranking model (called the weak labeler) for training NRMs. Weakly supervised NRMs can generalize from the observed data and significantly outperform the weak labeler. This paper generalizes this idea through an iterative re-labeling process, demonstrating that weakly supervised models can iteratively play the role of weak labeler and significantly improve ranking performance without using manually labeled data. The proposed Generalized Weak Supervision (GWS) solution is generic and orthogonal to the ranking model architecture. This paper offers four implementations of GWS: self-labeling, cross-labeling, joint cross- and self-labeling, and greedy multi-labeling. GWS also benefits from a query importance weighting mechanism based on query performance prediction methods to reduce noise in the generated training data. We further draw a theoretical connection between self-labeling and Expectation-Maximization. Our experiments on four retrieval benchmarks suggest that our implementations of GWS lead to substantial improvements compared to weak supervision if the weak labeler is sufficiently reliable.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) aim to provide personalized recommendations by interacting with users through conversations. Most existing studies of CRS focus on extracting user preferences from conversational contexts. However, due to the short and sparse nature of conversational contexts, it is difficult to fully capture user preferences by conversational contexts only. We argue that multi-modal semantic information can enrich user preference expressions from diverse dimensions (e.g., a user preference for a certain movie may stem from its magnificent visual effects and compelling storyline). In this paper, we propose a multi-modal semantic graph prompt learning framework for CRS, named MSCRS. First, we extract textual and image features of items mentioned in the conversational contexts. Second, we capture higher-order semantic associations within different semantic modalities (collaborative, textual, and image) by constructing modality-specific graph structures. Finally, we propose an innovative integration of multi-modal semantic graphs with prompt learning, harnessing the power of large language models to comprehensively explore high-dimensional semantic relationships. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves accuracy in item recommendation, as well as generates more natural and contextually relevant content in response generation.

       "    'abstract': 'Interactive recommender systems (IRSs) aim to meet user needs through natural language dialogues, optimizing recommendations with minimal interactions. Typically, IRSs are based on large language models (LLMs). Existing methods generally consist of two stages: decision-making (deciding whether to recommend or ask clarification questions) and action execution (generating recommendations or clarification questions). These methods usually follow a decision-first paradigm, where the model first decides on the action based on past conversations, and then executes the corresponding action. Since LLMs struggle to process a large number of candidate items, the recommendation process is often carried out in collaboration with external recommendation tools, which provide a small candidate set for LLMs to refine.  Existing methods face two key information gaps: (1) In the decision-making stage, the decision-first paradigm relies solely on past conversations, leading to incomplete decisions due to the uncertainty of subsequent actions` outcomes. (2) In the action execution stage, there is a unidirectional flow from external recommendation tools to LLMs, where these tools fail to interpret user preferences effectively, thus reducing the recommendation accuracy. To address these challenges, we introduce Action-First Interactive Recommender System(AF-IRS), a novel model that uses preference-aware actions to guide decision-making. Our Action-First paradigm informs decisions with future recommendations, ensuring more accurate decisions. Additionally, we establish a bidirectional interaction loop between LLMs and external recommendation tools, enabling LLMs to interpret and transmit session preferences for more precise recommendations. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that AF-IRS significantly improves both recommendation accuracy and efficiency, addressing the information gaps in both stages.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Proactive search in conversations (PSC) aims to reduce user effort in formulating explicit queries by proactively retrieving useful relevant information given conversational context. Previous work in PSC either directly uses this context as input to off-the-shelf ad-hoc retrievers or further fine-tunes them on PSC data. However, ad-hoc retrievers are pre-trained on short and concise queries, while the PSC input is longer and noisier. This input mismatch between ad-hoc search and PSC limits retrieval quality. While fine-tuning on PSC data helps, its benefits remain constrained by this input gap. In this work, we propose Conv2Query, a novel conversation-to-query framework that adapts ad-hoc retrievers to PSC by bridging the input gap between ad-hoc search and PSC. Conv2Query maps conversational context into ad-hoc queries, which can either be used as input for off-the-shelf ad-hoc retrievers or for further fine-tuning on PSC data.

       "    'abstract': 'Conversational recommendation systems (CRSs) use multi-turn interaction to capture user preferences and provide personalized recommendations. A fundamental challenge in CRSs lies in effectively understanding user preferences from conversations. Previous research primarily focuses on the issue of insufficient contextual information in conversations. They address this by introducing external knowledge sources, such as knowledge graphs, large language models (LLMs), and conversational recommendation corpora. Based on this, they design specific alignment strategies (e.g., prompt learning and instruction tuning) to integrate such knowledge for user preference understanding and item recommendation. However, user preferences can be multifaceted and complex, posing significant challenges for accurate recommendations even with access to abundant external knowledge. While interaction with users can clarify their true preferences, frequent user involvement may lead to a degraded user experience. To address this problem, we propose a Generative Reward model based Simulated User, named GRSU, for automatic interaction with CRSs. The simulated user provides feedback to the items recommended by CRSs, enabling them to better capture intricate user preferences through multi-turn interaction. Inspired by generative reward models, we design two types of feedback actions for the simulated user: i.e., generative item scoring, which offers coarse-grained feedback, and attribute-based item critiquing, which provides fine-grained feedback. To ensure seamless integration, these feedback actions are unified into an instruction-based format, allowing the development of a unified simulated user via instruction tuning on synthesized data. With this simulated user, automatic multi-turn interaction with CRSs can be effectively conducted. Furthermore, to strike a balance between effectiveness and efficiency, we draw inspiration from the paradigm of reward-guided search in complex reasoning tasks and employ beam search for the interaction process. On top of this, we propose an efficient candidate ranking method to improve the recommendation results derived from interaction.

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced CS by enabling query rewriting based on conversational context. However, employing LLMs during inference poses efficiency challenges. Existing solutions mitigate this issue by distilling embeddings derived from human-rewritten queries, focusing primarily on learning the context modeling task. These methods, however, often separate the contrastive retrieval task from the distillation process, treating it as an independent loss term. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DiSCo (Distillation of Sparse Conversational retrieval), a novel approach that unifies retrieval and context modeling through a relaxed distillation objective. Instead of relying exclusively on representation learning, our method distills similarity scores between conversations and documents, providing more freedom in the representation space and better leveraging the contrastive nature of document relevance. Extensive experiments on Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) across five CS datasets demonstrate that DiSCo achieves substantial improvements in both in-domain and out-of-domain retrieval tasks, achieving up to a six-point gain in recall for out-of-domain datasets over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, DiSCo employs a multi-teacher distillation strategy, using multiple LLMs as teachers, further enhancing performance and surpassing the individual teachers in in-domain settings. Furthermore, analysis of model sparsity reveals that DiSCo allows for more effective control over the sparsity of the trained models.',\n",

Existing adversarial training methods for deep hashing simultaneously optimize original deep hashing loss and proposed adversarial training loss to train a robust model. However, we argue that directly using the original deep hashing loss will guide the model to learn excessive non-robust patterns from clean examples when extracting discriminative semantic information, thereby limiting model robustness. To tackle this, we propose a novel Clean model Representation Distillation based Adversarial Training (CRDAT) method, which enables the robust model to learn both discriminative semantic information and robust patterns by separating these two losses into two stages, i.e., standard training stage of a clean teacher model and adversarial training stage of a robust student model. Specifically, we propose a novel representation distillation based adversarial training loss, which distills the representations of the teacher model on clean examples at both the hash code level and feature level to guide the student model`s learning on adversarial examples.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel model to introduce contextual disentanglement for improving conversational recommender systems, named DisenCRS. The proposed model DisenCRS employs a dual disentanglement framework, including self-supervised contrastive disentanglement and counterfactual inference disentanglement, to effectively distinguish focus information and background information from the dialogue context under unsupervised conditions. Moreover, we design an adaptive prompt learning module to automatically select the most suitable prompt based on the specific dialogue context, fully leveraging the power of large language models. Experimental results on two widely used public datasets demonstrate that DisenCRS significantly outperforms existing conversational recommendation models, achieving superior performance on both item recommendation and response generation tasks.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'In information retrieval (IR), providing appropriate clarifications to better understand users` information needs is crucial for building a proactive search-oriented dialogue system. Due to the strong in-context learning ability of large language models (LLMs), recent studies investigate prompting methods to generate clarifications using few-shot or Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts. However, vanilla CoT prompting does not distinguish the characteristics of different information needs, making it difficult to understand how LLMs resolve ambiguities in user queries. In this work, we focus on the concept of ambiguity for clarification, seeking to model and integrate ambiguities in the clarification process. Following the reasoning and acting paradigm, we propose a new prompting scheme Ambiguity Type-Chain of Thought (AT-CoT), which enhances the reasoning abilities of LLMs by limiting CoT to first predict ambiguity types that can be interpreted as actions, then generate clarifications correspondingly. Experiments are conducted on various datasets containing human-annotated clarifying questions to compare AT-CoT with multiple baselines. We also perform user simulation to implicitly measure the quality of generated clarifications under various IR scenarios.

       "    'abstract': 'Zero-shot instance-level sketch retrieval addresses a practical retrieval scenario in which sketches from unseen categories during training serve as queries to retrieve matching RGB images. The core challenges of this task lie in two aspects: unknown category generalization and subjective style adaptation. Existing methods either focus solely on category generalization or apply simplistic style elimination techniques within a specific category, leading to suboptimal performance when both challenges are present. To this end, we propose the Dual-Attentive Prompt (DAP) method, which unifies category generalization and style adaptation into a single, interpretable framework. Central to DAP is a dual-attentive prompt composer, consisting of two self-attention-based modules. This composer dynamically integrates pre-learned category-specific knowledge with instance-specific prompts that adapt to sketch-specific styles. By cooperating with additional style alignment loss, the proposed method ensures robust generalization of unseen categories while mitigating the impact of subjective style variations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method. Additionally, some insights are provided into the challenges of traditional training processes when handling multi-style sketches, along with quantitative and qualitative evidence showing how the proposed approach effectively mitigates the negative impact of subjective style variations.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Cross-domain contract element extraction (CEE) aims to transfer knowledge from a source domain to facilitate the extraction of legally relevant elements (e.g., contract dates or payments) from contracts in a target domain. To achieve this goal, recent studies encode the domain-invariant relations between elements and legal clause types and enhance performance through bidirectional supervision between the CEE task and the clause classification task. However, two challenges remain unresolved—(i) data sparsity due to expensive annotation costs and a large number of element types, and (ii) label discrepancies among element types across domains, both of which severely impede effective knowledge transfer from the source to the target domain. Recent developments in prompt learning have shown promising performance in low-resource settings. Drawing inspiration from these advances, we propose a novel framework, graph-enhanced prompt learning (GEPL), for the cross-domain CEE task to address these challenges. GEPL includes two kinds of prompt: (i) instance-oriented prompts and (ii) label-oriented prompts. Given the input instances, instance-oriented prompts are automatically generated by retrieving relevant examples in the training data, providing auxiliary supervision to enhance the transfer process in low-resource scenarios. To mitigate label discrepancies across different domains, we identify relations among element types using mutual-information criteria and transform these into label-oriented prompt templates. On this basis, a multi-task training strategy is designed to simultaneously optimize the representations of the original input sentence and prompts, enabling GEPL to better understand the tasks and capture label relations in both source and target domains. Empirical results on cross-domain CEE datasets indicate that GEPL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, extensive experiments reveal that GEPL achieves the state-of-the-art performance on cross-domain named entity recognition datasets and demonstrates a high level of generalizability.

Traditional studies have typically approached this task as a discriminative problem, matching the text and image via the cross-attention mechanism (one-tower framework) or in a common embedding space (two-tower framework). The one-tower framework excels in effectiveness but falls short in efficiency, whereas the two-tower framework is efficient but struggles to maintain competitive effectiveness. In this study, we aim to enhance both effectiveness and efficiency by transforming the text-to-image retrieval task into a token-to-voken generation problem, where fine-grained interactions are incorporated to improve effectiveness while maintaining high efficiency. Despite its potential advantages, this paradigm shift presents significant challenges: 1) misalignment with high-level semantics and 2) learning gap towards the retrieval target. To address the challenges, we propose AVG, which discretizes images into vokens while aligning with both the visual information and high-level semantics. Additionally, to bridge the learning gap between generative training and the retrieval target, AVG incorporates discriminative training to modify the learning direction during token-to-voken training. Experiments demonstrate that the benefits of paradigm innovation are realized: compared with the classical two-tower method, CLIP, AVG achieves the 7.53% relative effectiveness improvement and also 4× efficiency improvement.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Interactive Text-to-image retrieval (I-TIR) is an important enabler for a wide range of state-of-the-art services in domains such as e-commerce and education. However, current methods rely on finetuned Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which are costly to train and update, and exhibit poor generalizability. This latter issue is of particular concern, as: 1) finetuning narrows the pretrained distribution of MLLMs, thereby reducing generalizability; and 2) I-TIR introduces increasing query diversity and complexity. As a result, I-TIR solutions are highly likely to encounter queries and images not well represented in any training dataset. To address this, we propose leveraging Diffusion Models (DMs) for text-to-image mapping, to avoid finetuning MLLMs while preserving robust performance on complex queries. Specifically, we introduce Diffusion Augmented Retrieval (DAR), a framework that generates multiple intermediate representations via LLM-based dialogue refinements and DMs, producing a richer depiction of the user`s information needs. This augmented representation facilitates more accurate identification of semantically and visually related images. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks show that for simple queries, DAR achieves results on par with finetuned I-TIR models, yet without incurring their tuning overhead. Moreover, as queries become more complex through additional conversational turns, DAR surpasses finetuned I-TIR models by up to 7.61% in Hits@10 after ten turns, illustrating its improved generalization for more intricate queries.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) takes a composed query of a reference image and a text describing the user`s intention, with the aim to retrieve the target image under both conditions. Conventional CIR approaches heavily rely on massive annotated triplets, which often comes at a considerable cost. Zero-Shot CIR (ZS-CIR) offers a new solution that can perform diverse CIR tasks without training on the triplet datasets. The key to the ZS-CIR task is to make specified changes to specific objects in the reference image based on the text. Previous works utilize a projection module to map the reference image into single or multiple pseudo words. However, they are either only applicable to single-object scenarios, or naively convert entire image features into multiple pseudo words and fail to focus on the desired target objects specified by the text description. In this work, we rethink how to learn pseudo words based on the objects attended by the text and propose a Multi-Object Aware ZS-CIR framework (MOA). Specifically, a multi-object recognizer first recognizes valid objects in the reference image guided by a set of learnable object queries. Then, we devise an object filtering strategy, which utilizes contextual prompts comprised of noun categories to guide the model in precisely screening out the objects that need to be modified. Finally, the pseudo word learning branch adaptively converts the screened objects into multiple pseudo words for accurate ZS-CIR. Although simple, our MOA consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods across diverse benchmarks and even achieves competitive results with many supervised methods.',\n",

The main challenge in EITM lies in bridging the substantial semantic gap between entity-related information in texts and images, which is more pronounced than in general image-text matching problems. To address this challenge, we adopt CLIP as our foundational model and devise a Multimodal Attentive Experts (MMAE)-based contrastive learning to adapt CLIP into an expert for EITM problem. Particularly, the core of our multimodal attentive experts learning is to generate explanation texts by Large Language Models (LLMs) as bridging clues. In specific, we first employ off-the-shelf LLMs to generate explanatory text. This text, along with the original image and text, is then fed into our Multimodal Attentive Experts module to narrow the semantic gap within a unified semantic space. Upon the enriched feature representations generated by MMAE, we have further developed an effective Gated Integrative Image-text Matching (GI-ITM) strategy. GI-ITM utilizes an adaptive gating mechanism to combine features from MMAE, followed by applying image-text matching constraints to enhance the alignment precision.

The granularity and the usability of the knowledge are key issues: the former is determined by entity recognition on CTRs, whereas the latter mainly depends on proper relation extraction. Nevertheless, in the state-of-the-art entity recognition methods on CTRs using span representation, the local semantics of behavior are not considered and the sequential features of entity labels within behavior descriptions are not utilized. Besides, domain-specific definitions/forms of the relation types and knowledge representations are also crucial for effective utilization of knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge extraction framework on CTRs to address the above concerns. The framework is formed by the Enhanced Security Profiles (ESP) that can be directly utilized by security detection devices. In the ESP framework, we propose 3 modules to facilitate fine-grained and accurate knowledge extractions: (1) The entity recognition module utilizes a label-aware subsequence autoregressive algorithm to integrate local semantic and label sequence features, enabling accurate identification of cybersecurity entities; (2) The relation extraction module employs LLM-based strategies with shared partition representations to enhance semantic understanding and domain relevance; and (3) The security profile generation module leverages Chain-of-Thought reasoning and In-Context Learning to produce machine-readable rules executable in security detection systems. Extensive experiments on 6 datasets demonstrate that the ESP framework largely outperform the state-of-the-art solutions e.g., the Micro-Fl scores on entity recognition and relation extraction are at least 1.54% and 13.12% better, respectively.

However, these models typically adopt simpler structures to reduce complexity and avoid overfitting, which limits their ability to effectively capture the sequential characteristics of learning compared to sequence-based methods. To address these limitations, this paper aims to integrate the strengths of both types of methods by proposing an Interpretable KT approach with Difficulty-Aware Attention and Selective State Space Model (ASIKT). Specifically, leveraging educational context, we design a difficulty-enhanced attention mechanism to model students` knowledge retrieval process at a fine-grained level without introducing additional parameters.

       "    'abstract': 'The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for simulating user behavior in the domain of Interactive Information Retrieval has recently gained significant popularity. However, their application and capabilities remain highly debated and understudied. This study explores whether the underlying principles of contrastive training techniques, which have been effective for fine-tuning LLMs, can also be applied beneficially in the area of prompt engineering for user simulations. Previous research has shown that LLMs possess comprehensive world knowledge, which can be leveraged to provide accurate estimates of relevant documents. This study attempts to simulate a knowledge state by enhancing the model with additional implicit contextual information gained during the simulation. This approach enables the model to refine the scope of desired documents further. The primary objective of this study is to analyze how different modalities of contextual information influence the effectiveness of user simulations. Various user configurations were tested, where models are provided with summaries of already judged relevant, irrelevant, or both types of documents in a contrastive manner. The focus of this study is the assessment of the impact of the prompting techniques on the simulated user agent performance. We hereby lay the foundations for leveraging LLMs as part of more realistic simulated users.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Content-based Music Retrieval (CBMR) is a fundamental task in music information retrieval, encompassing sub-tasks including Audio Identification, Audio Matching, and Version Identification. Traditional methods typically analyze audio signals or spectrograms to extract features related to rhythm, melody, harmony, and timbre. However, with the rapid development of Music Transcription and digital music technologies, MIDI representation has emerged as a powerful alternative for music analysis. In this paper, we propose MIDI-Zero, a novel self-supervised learning framework for CBMR that operates entirely on MIDI representations. Unlike existing approaches, MIDI-Zero requires no external training data; all training data is automatically generated based on predefined task rules, eliminating the need for labeled datasets or external music collections. MIDI-Zero is designed to handle both symbolic music data and audio-based tasks by leveraging Music Transcription models. Its strong robustness ensures effectiveness even with low-quality transcriptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MIDI-Zero achieves competitive performance across various CBMR sub-tasks, particularly excelling in Audio Matching. Our approach simplifies the feature extraction process, bridges the gap between audio and symbolic music representations, and offers a versatile and scalable solution for music retrieval.',\n",

Federated approaches to ranking of search results have recently garnered attention to address users privacy concerns. In FOLTR, privacy is safeguarded by collaboratively training ranking models across decentralized data sources, preserving individual user data while optimizing search results based on implicit feedback, such as clicks.Recent legislation introduced across numerous countries is establishing the so called ``\\\\emph{the right to be forgotten}``, according to which services based on machine learning models like those in FOLTR should provide capabilities that allow users to remove their own data from those used to train models. This has sparked the development of unlearning methods, along with evaluation practices to measure whether unlearning of a user data successfully occurred. Current evaluation practices are however often controversial, necessitating the use of multiple metrics for a more comprehensive assessment -- but previous proposals of unlearning methods only used single evaluation metrics. This paper addresses this limitation: our study rigorously assesses the effectiveness of unlearning strategies in managing both under-unlearning and over-unlearning scenarios using adapted, and newly proposed evaluation metrics.Thanks to our detailed analysis, we uncover the strengths and limitations of five unlearning strategies, offering valuable insights into optimizing federated unlearning to balance data privacy and system performance within FOLTR.

       "    'abstract': 'The fundamental property of Cranfield-style evaluations, that system rankings are stable even when assessors disagree on individual relevance decisions, was validated on traditional test collections. However, the paradigm shift towards neural retrieval models affected the characteristics of modern test collections, e.g., documents are short, judged with four grades of relevance, and information needs have no descriptions or narratives. Under these changes, it is unclear whether assessor disagreement remains negligible for system comparisons. We investigate this aspect under the additional condition that the few modern test collections are heavily re-used. Given more possible query interpretations due to less formalized information needs, an ``expiration date`` for test collections might be needed if top-effectiveness requires overfitting to a single interpretation of relevance. We run a reproducibility study and re-annotate the relevance judgments of the 2019~TREC Deep Learning track. We can reproduce prior work in the neural retrieval setting, showing that assessor disagreement does not affect system rankings. However, we observe that some models substantially degrade with our new relevance judgments, and some have already reached the effectiveness of humans as rankers, providing evidence that test collections can expire.',\n",

The promise of such systems is that they are capable of generating better recommendations by predicting and considering the underlying motivations and short-term goals of consumers. From a technical perspective, various sophisticated neural models were recently proposed in this emerging and promising area. In the broader context of complex neural recommendation models, a growing number of research works unfortunately indicates that (i) reproducing such works is often difficult and (ii) that the true benefits of such models may be limited in reality, e.g., because the reported improvements were obtained through comparisons with untuned or weak baselines. In this work, we investigate if recent research in IARS is similarly affected by such problems. Specifically, we tried to reproduce five contemporary IARS models that were published in top-level outlets, and we benchmarked them against a number of traditional non-neural recommendation models.  In two of the cases, running the provided code with the optimal hyperparameters reported in the paper did not yield the results reported in the paper. Worryingly, we find that all examined IARS approaches are consistently outperformed by at least one traditional model.

       "    'abstract': 'Over the past few years, researchers have explored the use of reinforcement learning (RL) for sequential recommendation problems. However, since RL techniques commonly target at optimizing long-term rewards, it is surprising that RL-based models are reported to be competitive with traditional supervised models when evaluated under the myopic next-item prediction protocol. A recent study suggests that reported performance gains of combining RL with supervised learning techniques, as done in the Self-Supervised Q-Learning (SQN) framework, may actually not come from learning an optimal policy, but that the RL component helps to learn embeddings that encode the users` past interactions. Given these observations, we aimed to reassess the performance of RL-enhanced sequential recommendations in the SQN framework. While we were able to reproduce the results reported in the respective papers, we found that properly-tuned supervised learning models like GRU4Rec substantially outperform the proposed RL-models from the literature. Our analyses furthermore revealed that there is a significant inconsistency in terms of evaluation protocols in the literature, and that the use of third-party implementations of existing models may lead to unreliable conclusions. Overall, still more research and alternative evaluation schemes seem required to fully leverage the power of RL for sequential recommendation tasks.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Generative retrieval (GR) has emerged as a promising paradigm in information retrieval (IR). However, most existing GR models are developed and evaluated using a static document collection, and their performance in dynamic corpora where document collections evolve continuously is rarely studied. In this paper, we first reproduce and systematically evaluate various representative GR approaches over dynamic corpora. Through extensive experiments, we reveal that existing GR models with text-based docids show superior generalization to unseen documents. We observe that the more fine-grained the docid design in the GR model, the better its performance over dynamic corpora, surpassing BM25 and even being comparable to dense retrieval methods. While GR models with numeric-based docids show high efficiency, their performance drops significantly over dynamic corpora.  Furthermore, our experiments find that the underperformance of numeric-based docids is partly due to their excessive tendency toward the initial document set, which likely results from overfitting on the training set. We then conduct an in-depth analysis of the best-performing GR methods. We identify three critical advantages of text-based docids in dynamic corpora: (i) Semantic alignment with language models` pretrained knowledge, (ii) Fine-grained docid design, and (iii) High lexical diversity. Building on these insights, we finally propose a novel multi-docid design that leverages both the efficiency of numeric-based docids and the effectiveness of text-based docids, achieving improved performance in dynamic corpus without requiring additional retraining. Our work offers empirical evidence for advancing GR methods over dynamic corpora and paves the way for developing more generalized yet efficient GR models in real-world search engines.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Graph-based social recommender systems have demonstrated great potential in alleviating data sparsity by leveraging high-order user influence embedded in social networks. However, most existing methods rely heavily on the observed social graph, which is often noisy and includes spurious or task-irrelevant connections that can mislead user preference learning. Identifying and removing these noisy relations is crucial but challenging due to the lack of ground-truth annotations. In this paper, we approach the social denoising problem from the perspective of graph invariant learning and propose a novel approach, Social Graph Invariant Learning(SGIL). Specifically, SGIL aims to uncover stable user preferences within the input social graph, thereby enhancing the robustness of graph-based social recommendation systems. To achieve this goal, SGIL first simulates multiple noisy social environments through graph generators. It then seeks to learn environment-invariant user preferences by minimizing invariant risk across these environments. To further promote diversity in the generated social environments, we employ an adversarial training strategy to simulate more potential social noisy distributions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SGIL. The code is available at https://github.com/yimutianyang/SIGIR2025-SGIL.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Knowledge graphs (KGs) consist of well-organized external information and have been proven to enhance recommendation quality effectively. Most KG-aware recommender systems are developed using real number space embeddings. In recent years, learning representations in the hypercomplex space has gained success and attention. Compared to single-component real-valued vectors, multi-component hypercomplex embeddings offer greater expressiveness, facilitating more meaningful modeling of users, items, entities, and their relations in the user-item interaction graph and KG. In this paper, we explore the integration of hypercomplex algebras in KG-aware recommendation and propose a Hypercomplex Knowledge Graph-aware Recommender (HKGR) method. Our HKGR models the interaction graph and KG in the hypercomplex space by utilizing specially designed hypercomplex graph neural networks. In particular, HKGR employs a hypercomplex attention-based aggregator to capture the structure and semantics of the KG. In the recommendation prediction phase, we design a hypercomplex interaction network that can approximate the high-order component interactions between users and items. Furthermore, we introduce a hypercomplex contrastive learning operator to strengthen cooperative signals between the interaction graph and KG modelings. Experiment results on the four real-world datasets show that our HKGR outperforms the state-of-the-art recommender baselines.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Recommender systems (RSs) are designed to retrieve candidate items a user might be interested in from a large pool, with a typical approach being the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture high-order interaction relationships. As large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across various domains, researchers are exploring ways to apply their capabilities for improving recommendation performance. However, existing work limits the use of LLMs to either re-ranking recommendation results of traditional RSs or pre-processing the datasets as data augmenters. Both lines of work failed to explore LLMs` capabilities during the filtering process of candidate items, which may lead to suboptimal performance. Instead, we propose to leverage LLMs` reasoning abilities during the candidate filtering process, and introduce Chain Of Retrieval ON grAphs (CORONA) to progressively narrow down the range of candidate items on interaction graphs with the help of LLMs: (1) First, LLM performs preference reasoning based on user profiles, with the response serving as a query to extract relevant users and items from the interaction graph as preference-assisted retrieval ; (2) Then, using the information retrieved in the previous step along with the purchase history of target user, LLM conducts intent reasoning to help refine an even smaller interaction subgraph as intent-assisted retrieval ; (3) Finally, we employ a GNN to capture high-order collaborative filtering information from the extracted subgraph, performing GNN-enhanced retrieval to generate the final recommendation results. The proposed framework leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs during the retrieval process, while seamlessly integrating GNNs to enhance overall recommendation performance. Extensive experiments on various datasets and settings demonstrate that our proposed CORONA achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with an 18.6% relative improvement in recall and an 18.4% relative improvement in NDCG on average.

This has resulted in a close connection between short videos and live streaming within these platforms. Incorporating short video data into live streaming recommendation through cross-domain approaches can effectively mitigate the sparsity of live streaming gifting data. However, existing cross-domain recommendation methods primarily focus on transferring information across domains through overlapping users or items, while overlooking the strong connection between non-overlapping short videos and streamers. In this paper, we propose MGCCDR, a Multi-Graph Contrastive learning framework for Cross-Domain Recommendation, which leverages both overlapping users and non-overlapping items to enhance information transfer. Specifically, we first learn global representations from a global graph to establish connections between streamers and short videos. Subsequently, we construct three bipartite graphs among users, authors, and videos and introduce multi-graph learning to capture preferences within the target domain view, the source domain view, and the cross-domain view. Additionally, to address the varying contributions of each graph to the final recommendation task, we design an attention-based method to effectively integrate these representations, facilitating the information aggregation across domains. Extensive experiments on both commercial and public datasets demonstrate that our MGCCDR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Advanced relevance models, such as those that use large language models (LLMs), provide highly accurate relevance estimations. However, their computational costs make them infeasible for processing large document corpora. To address this, retrieval systems often employ a telescoping approach, where computationally efficient but less precise lexical and semantic retrievers filter potential candidates for further ranking. However, this approach heavily depends on the quality of early-stage retrieval, which can potentially exclude relevant documents early in the process. In this work, we propose a novel paradigm for re-ranking called online relevance estimation that continuously updates relevance estimates for a query throughout the ranking process. Instead of re-ranking a fixed set of top-k documents in a single step, online relevance estimation iteratively re-scores smaller subsets of the most promising documents while adjusting relevance scores for the remaining pool based on the estimations from the final model using an online bandit-based algorithm. This dynamic process mitigates the recall limitations of telescoping systems by re-prioritizing documents initially deemed less relevant by earlier stages--including those completely excluded by earlier-stage retrievers. We validate our approach on TREC benchmarks under two scenarios: hybrid retrieval and adaptive retrieval. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is sample-efficient and significantly improves recall, highlighting the effectiveness of our online relevance estimation framework for modern search systems.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Learning to Rank (LTR) methods generally assume that each document in a top-K ranking is presented in an equal format. However, previous work has shown that users` perceptions of relevance can be changed by varying presentations, i.e., allocating more vertical space to some documents to provide additional textual or image information. Furthermore, presentation length can also redirect attention, as users are more likely to notice longer presentations when scrolling through results. Deciding on the document presentation lengths in a fixed vertical space ranking is an important problem that has not been addressed by existing LTR methods. We address this gap by introducing the variable presentation length ranking task, where simultaneously the ordering of documents and their presentation length is decided. Despite being a generalization of standard ranking, we show that this setting brings significant new challenges: Firstly, the probability ranking principle no longer applies to this setting, and secondly, the problem cannot be divided into separate ordering and length selection tasks. We therefore propose VLPL -- a new family of Plackett-Luce list-wise gradient estimation methods for the joint optimization of document ordering and lengths. Our semi-synthetic experiments show that VLPL can effectively balance the expected exposure and attractiveness of all documents, achieving the best performance across different ranking settings. Furthermore, we observe that even simple length-aware methods can achieve significant performance improvements over fixed-length models. Altogether, our theoretical and empirical results highlight the importance and difficulties of combining document presentation with LTR.',\n",

To enhance representation learning in HTGs, numerous tailored neural networks have recently been proposed. Despite these successes, existing methods adopt independent parameterization strategies to handle various data distributions in HTGs, leading to optimization challenges and speed bottlenecks. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a novel transformer-based representation learning paradigm for HTGs called HTGformer. Specifically, assisted by two major modules, i.e., a graph embedding layer and a heterogeneous-temporal encoder, HTGformer can effectively and efficiently capture spatio-temporal heterogeneous information in HTGs for comprehensive node representations.

In real-world scenarios, users` interactions often exhibit cross-domain characteristics and are influenced by others. However, the memory design in current methods causes user agents to introduce significant irrelevant information during decision-making in cross-domain scenarios and makes them unable to recognize the influence of other users` interactions, such as popularity factors. To tackle this issue, we propose a dual-layer memory architecture combined with a two-step fusion mechanism. This design avoids irrelevant information during decision-making while ensuring effective integration of cross-domain preferences.

       "    'abstract': 'Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly central to recommendation scenarios due to their remarkable natural language understanding and generation capabilities. Although significant research has explored the use of LLMs for various recommendation tasks, little effort has been dedicated to verifying whether they have memorized public recommendation dataset as part of their training data. This is undesirable because memorization reduces the generalizability of research findings, as benchmarking on memorized datasets does not guarantee generalization to unseen datasets. Furthermore, memorization can amplify biases, for example, some popular items may be recommended more frequently than others. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs have memorized public recommendation datasets. Specifically, we examine two model families (GPT and Llama) across multiple sizes, focusing on one of the most widely used dataset in recommender systems: MovieLens-1M. First, we define dataset memorization as the extent to which item attributes, user profiles, and user-item interactions can be retrieved by prompting the LLMs. Second, we analyze the impact of memorization on recommendation performance. Lastly, we examine whether memorization varies across model families and model sizes. Our results reveal that all models exhibit some degree of memorization of MovieLens-1M, and that recommendation performance is related to the extent of memorization.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'In recommendation systems, user interests are always in a state of constant flux. Typically, a user interest experiences a emergent phase, a stable phase, and a declining phase, which are referred to as the ``user interest life-cycle``. Recent papers on user interest modeling have primarily focused on how to compute the correlation between the target item and user`s historical behaviors, without thoroughly considering the life-cycle features of user interest. In this paper, we propose an effective method called Deep Interest Life-cycle Network (DILN), which not only captures the interest life-cycle features efficiently, but can also be easily integrated to existing ranking models. DILN contains two key components: Interest Life-cycle Encoder Module constructs historical activity histograms of the user interest and then encodes them into dense representation. Interest Life-cycle Fusion Module injects the encoded dense representation into multiple expert networks, with the aim of enabling the specific phase of interest life-cycle to activate distinct experts. Online A/B testing reveals that DILN achieves significant improvements of +0.38% in CTR, +1.04% in CVR and +0.25% in duration per user, which demonstrates its effectiveness. In addition, DILN inherently increase the exposure of users` emergent and stable interests while decreasing the exposure of declining interests. DILN has been deployed on the Lofter App.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Signed bipartite graphs are widely employed in social networks, recommender systems, and other domains, where the nodes represent two different sets, such as users and commodities, and the links have positive and negative signs to reflect the ratings. Link sign prediction is a crucial task, but the link class imbalance when one type of link (e.g., the head class) is significantly more numerous than another (e.g., the tail class) makes this task extremely challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a Line-Graph-Based Dynamic Balancing Prediction (LDBP) method. Specifically, we first convert the links of a signed bipartite graph into nodes of a line graph, and then the link class imbalance problem in the bipartite graph is naturally transformed to the problem of node class imbalance in the line graph. To tackle this problem, we introduce a Centroid Contrastive Learning (CCL) method and design a Dynamic Synthesis & Deletion (DSD) strategy for the tail-class nodes. By dynamically adjusting the quantity of synthesized tail-class nodes, we obtain a Balanced Line Graph (BaLG). Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving the accuracy of link sign prediction and addressing the issue of link class imbalance.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Click-through rate (CTR) prediction plays an important role in online advertising systems. On the one hand, traditional CTR prediction models capture the collaborative signals in tabular data via feature interaction modeling, but they lose semantics in text. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in understanding the context and meaning behind text, but they face challenges in capturing collaborative signals and they have long inference latency. In this paper, we aim to leverage the benefits of both types of models and pursue collaboration, semantics and efficiency. We present ELEC, which is an Efficient LLM-Empowered CTR prediction framework. We first adapt an LLM for the CTR prediction task. In order to leverage the ability of the LLM but simultaneously keep efficiency, we utilize the pseudo-siamese network which contains a gain network and a vanilla network. We inject the high-level representation vector generated by the LLM into a collaborative CTR model to form the gain network such that it can take advantage of both tabular modeling and textual modeling. However, its reliance on the LLM limits its efficiency. We then distill the knowledge from the gain network to the vanilla network on both the score level and the representation level, such that the vanilla network takes only tabular data as input, but can still generate comparable performance as the gain network. Our approach is model-agnostic. It allows for the integration with various existing LLMs and collaborative CTR models. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of ELEC for CTR prediction.',\n",

However, existing summarization methods often generate broad, high-level summaries, which may lack the precision and detail required for financial reports that typically focus on specific, structured sections. While Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise, generating reports adhering to predefined multi-section templates remains challenging. This paper investigates two LLM-based approaches popular in industry for generating templated financial reports: an agentic information retrieval (IR) framework and a decomposed IR approach, namely AgenticIR and DecomposedIR. The AgenticIR utilizes collaborative agents prompted with the full template. In contrast, the DecomposedIR approach applies a prompt chaining workflow to break down the template and reframe each section as a query answered by the LLM using the earnings release. To quantitatively assess the generated reports, we evaluated both methods in two scenarios: one using a financial dataset without direct human references, and another with a weather-domain dataset featuring expert-written reports. Experimental results show that while AgenticIR may excel in orchestrating tasks and generating concise reports through agent collaboration, DecomposedIR statistically significantly outperforms AgenticIR approach in providing broader and more detailed coverage in both scenarios, offering reflection on the utilization of the agentic framework in real-world applications.',\n",

To tackle this limitation, we propose EvoPro, an Evolution-aware Prompt-augmented framework that enhances MVPP.

Building upon this, a graph-based prompter generates evolutionary prompts by capturing the relational structures within the support set. These prompts, representing the latest trend dynamics, serve as few-shot examples to guide PVLs.

To overcome this limitation, we propose a fact-level confidence calibration framework that evaluates and adjusts confidence at the granularity of individual facts, incorporating both relevance and correctness.

       "    'abstract': 'With the rapid growth of user historical behavior data, user interest modeling has become a prominent aspect in Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, focusing on learning user intent representations. However, this complexity poses computational challenges, requiring a balance between model performance and acceptable response times for online services. Traditional methods often utilize filtering techniques. These techniques can lead to the loss of significant information by prioritizing top K items based on item attributes or employing low-precision attention mechanisms. In this study, we introduce LREA, a novel attention mechanism that overcomes the limitations of existing approaches while ensuring computational efficiency. LREA leverages low-rank matrix decomposition to optimize runtime performance and incorporates a specially designed loss function to maintain attention capabilities while preserving information integrity. During the inference phase, matrix absorption and pre-storage strategies are employed to effectively meet runtime constraints. The results of extensive offline and online experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.',\n",

To close this gap, we compare eight LLM~assessors on the TREC DL tracks and the retrieval task of the RAG track with each other and with human assessors. We find that the agreement between LLM~assessors is higher than between LLMs and humans and, importantly, that LLM~assessors favor retrieval systems that use LLMs in their ranking decisions: our analyses with 30-50 retrieval systems show that the system rankings obtained by LLM~assessors overestimate LLM-based re-rankers by 9~to 17~positions on average.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The evaluation of Information Retrieval (IR) systems typically uses query-document pairs with corresponding human-labelled relevance assessments (qrels). These qrels are used to determine if one system is better than another based on average retrieval performance. Acquiring large volumes of human relevance assessments is expensive. Therefore, more efficient relevance assessment approaches have been proposed, necessitating comparisons between qrels to ascertain their efficacy. Discriminative power, i.e. the ability to correctly identify significant differences between systems, is important for drawing accurate conclusions on the robustness of qrels. Previous work has measured the proportion of pairs of systems that are identified as significantly different and has quantified Type I statistical errors. Type I errors lead to incorrect conclusions due to false positive significance tests. We argue that also identifying Type II errors (false negatives) is important as they lead science in the wrong direction. We quantify Type II errors and propose that balanced classification metrics, such as balanced accuracy, can be used to portray the discriminative power of qrels. We perform experiments using qrels generated using alternative relevance assessment methods to investigate measuring hypothesis testing errors in IR evaluation. We find that additional insights into the discriminative power of qrels can be gained by quantifying Type II errors, and that balanced classification metrics can be used to give an overall summary of discriminative power in one, easily comparable, number.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Automated detection of semantically equivalent questions in longitudinal social science surveys is crucial for long-term studies informing empirical research in the social, economic, and health sciences. Retrieving equivalent questions faces dual challenges: inconsistent representation of theoretical constructs (i.e. concept/sub-concept) across studies as well as between question and response options, and the evolution of vocabulary and structure in longitudinal text. To address these challenges, our multi-disciplinary collaboration of computer scientists and survey specialists presents a new information retrieval (IR) task of identifying concept (e.g. Housing, Job, etc.) equivalence across question and response options to harmonise longitudinal population studies. This paper investigates multiple unsupervised approaches on a survey dataset spanning 1946-2020, including probabilistic models, linear probing of language models, and pre-trained neural networks specialised for IR. We show that IR-specialised neural models achieve the highest overall performance with other approaches performing comparably. Additionally, the re-ranking of the probabilistic model`s results with neural models only introduces modest improvements of 0.07 at most in F1-score. Qualitative post-hoc evaluation by survey specialists shows that models generally have a low sensitivity to questions with high lexical overlap, particularly in cases where sub-concepts are mismatched. Altogether, our analysis serves to further research on harmonising longitudinal studies in social science.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Query expansion (QE) enhances retrieval by incorporating relevant terms, with large language models (LLMs) offering an effective alternative to traditional rule-based and statistical methods. However, LLM-based QE suffers from a fundamental limitation: it often fails to generate relevant knowledge, degrading search performance. Prior studies have focused on hallucination, yet its underlying cause—LLM knowledge deficiencies—remains underexplored. This paper systematically examines two failure cases in LLM-based QE: (1) when the LLM lacks query knowledge, leading to incorrect expansions, and (2) when the query is ambiguous, causing biased refinements that narrow search coverage. We conduct controlled experiments across multiple datasets, evaluating the effects of knowledge and query ambiguity on retrieval performance using sparse and dense retrieval models. Our results reveal that LLM-based QE can significantly degrade the retrieval effectiveness when knowledge in the LLM is insufficient or query ambiguity is high. We introduce a framework for evaluating QE under these conditions, providing insights into the limitations of LLM-based retrieval augmentation.',\n",

In this study, we propose a novel Temporal Chain of Thought framework(TempCoT) to improve the performance of LLM in temporal reasoning tasks through a three-stage reasoning strategy. First, TempCoT explicitly extracts time constraints to ensure the accuracy of time references during reasoning. Second, a semantic retrieval mechanism is introduced to dynamically obtain key temporal facts to enhance the integrity and reliability of information. Finally, an explicit temporal logic reasoning module is constructed based on point algebra to improve the consistency and interpretability of reasoning.

       "    'abstract': 'In conversational recommender systems (CRSs), conversations usually involve a set of items and item-related entities or attributes, e.g., director is a related entity of a movie. These items and item-related entities are often mentioned along the development of a dialog, leading to potential sequential dependencies among them. However, most of existing CRSs neglect these potential sequential dependencies. In this article, we first propose a Transformer-based sequential conversational recommendation method, named TSCR, to model the sequential dependencies in the conversations to improve CRS. In TSCR, we represent conversations by items and the item-related entities, and construct user sequences to discover user preferences by considering both the mentioned items and item-related entities. Based on the constructed sequences, we deploy a Cloze task to predict the recommended items along a sequence. Meanwhile, in certain domains, knowledge graphs formed by the items and their related entities are readily available, which provide various different kinds of associations among them. Given that TSCR does not benefit from such knowledge graphs, we then propose a knowledge graph enhanced version of TSCR, called TSCRKG. In specific, we leverage the knowledge graph to offline initialize our model TSCRKG, and augment the user sequence of conversations (i.e., sequence of the mentioned items and item-related entities in the conversation) with multi-hop paths in the knowledge graph. Experimental results demonstrate that our TSCR model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, and the enhanced version TSCRKG further improves recommendation performance on top of TSCR.',\n",

The challenge of improving user experiences in complex systems with search and recommendation (S&R) services has drawn significant attention from both academia and industry these years. However, the lack of high-quality datasets has limited the research progress on multimodal S&R. To address the growing need for developing better S&R services, we present a novel multimodal information retrieval dataset in this paper, namely Qilin. The dataset is collected from Xiaohongshu, a popular social platform with over 300 million monthly active users and an average search penetration rate of over 70%. In contrast to existing datasets, Qilin offers a comprehensive collection of user sessions with heterogeneous results like image-text notes, video notes, commercial notes, and direct answers, facilitating the development of advanced multimodal neural retrieval models across diverse task settings. To better model user satisfaction and support the analysis of heterogeneous user behaviors, we also collect extensive APP-level contextual signals and genuine user feedback. Notably, Qilin contains user-favored answers and their referred results for search requests triggering the Deep Query Answering (DQA) module. This allows not only the training & evaluation of a Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, but also the exploration of how such a module would affect users` search behavior. Through comprehensive analysis and experiments, we provide interesting findings and insights for further improving S&R systems. We hope that Qilin will significantly contribute to the advancement of multimodal content platforms with S&R services in the future.',\n",

However, this reductionist approach fails to capture the dynamic nature of influencer marketing effectiveness.To bridge this gap, we present SAGraph, a novel comprehensive dataset from Weibo that captures multi-dimensional marketing campaign data across six product domains.

The risk of IR systems using LLMs and being susceptible to misinformation can be tackled under the lens of explainability in AI.  The topic of explainability in AI, machine learning (XAI) and information retrieval (IR) has been explored through various methods, yet few incorporate user feedback to adapt explanations. In this work, we present an XAI-driven extension to the classic relevance feedback model in IR, incorporating user feedback in the process of explaining the model behavior to the user. Our proposed model, RelEx, introduces XAI-specific elements, including key phrase vectors, text summaries, and contextual phrases combined with a neural ranker. RelEx interactively gathers user feedback, adapting search results based on the modified query and contextual vectors. We further introduce a novel additive similarity scheme that combines document similarity with key-phrase overlap. Retrieval performance is empirically evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets. In the absence of ground truth explanations, we assess explainability and assessability via user studies, where RelEx exhibit promising results.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized recommender systems by offering highly personalized and context-aware suggestions. However, their inherent biases pose significant challenges in sensitive scenarios like job recommendation, potentially compromising fairness and resulting in harmful effects on both users and platforms. While previous studies have explored fairness issues in LLM-based job recommendations, they often focus on limited dimensions. We introduce FairWork, a comprehensive fairness evaluation framework to examine LLM-based recommender system from both the user’s and recruiter’s perspectives, employing fairness metrics to assess how sensitive user attributes influence job recommendations. The system allows stakeholders such as recruitment platforms and job seekers to upload personalized profiles and job descriptions for fairness analysis. By integrating specific job requirements and user-driven data inputs, FairWork captures the relationship between candidate qualifications and job demands. This framework provides a robust foundation for evaluating fairness in LLM-based job recommender systems and supports future research on bias mitigation strategies.

We developed a comprehensive platform to collect user behavior and feedback on the generative IR system. This platform consists of: 1) a generative IR system that supports both API-based and customized retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods, 2) a user interface that logs various user behavior, including prompts, clicks, mouse movements, and scrolling, and 3) an annotation website that allows users to provide feedback.

Our method is able to synthesize diverse tasks and domain knowledge into a single model, enabling effective zero-shot adaptation in different retrieval contexts. Extensive experiments on publicly available scientific, biomedical, and multilingual datasets show that our method improves state-of-the-art re-ranking performance by up to 18% in NDCG@10 and 15% in P@10.

       "    'abstract': 'Knowledge Graphs (KGs), composed of triples in the form of (head, relation, tail) and consisting of entities and relations, play a key role in information retrieval systems such as question answering, entity search, and recommendation. In real-world KGs, although many entities exist, the relations exhibit a long-tail distribution, which can hinder information retrieval performance. Previous few-shot knowledge graph completion studies focused exclusively on the positive triple information that exists in the graph or, when negative triples were incorporated, used them merely as a signal to indicate incorrect triples. To overcome this limitation, we propose Relation-Based Conditional Diffusion with Attention Pooling (ReCDAP). First, negative triples are generated by randomly replacing the tail entity in the support set. By conditionally incorporating positive information in the KG and non-existent negative information into the diffusion process, the model separately estimates the latent distributions for positive and negative relations. Moreover, including an attention pooler enables the model to leverage the differences between positive and negative cases explicitly.

Ignoring prompts, even when explicitly instructed to follow them, may adversely affect performance and potentially lead to unintended consequences.

To address our research question, we propose \\\\textit{Oedipus}, an evaluation framework to evaluate LLMs` ability to follow prompts. We further note that such abilities could also be influenced by contamination (i.e., exposure to datasets during training) and parametric knowledge. Consequently, we develop a novel QA dataset with four types of contexts—\\\\textit{correct, masked, noisy}, and \\\\textit{absurd contexts} with \\\\textit{recent questions} that LLMs are unlikely to have encountered in pre-training data or corpus and cannot be answered from parametric knowledge.

       "    'abstract': 'Conversational Information Access systems have experienced widespread diffusion thanks to the natural and effortless interactions they enable with the user. In particular, they represent an effective interaction interface for conversational search (CS) and conversational recommendation (CR) scenarios. Despite their commonalities, CR and CS systems are often devised, developed, and evaluated as isolated components. Integrating these two elements would allow for handling complex information access scenarios, such as exploring unfamiliar recommended product aspects, enabling richer dialogues, and improving user satisfaction. As of today, the scarce availability of integrated datasets - focused exclusively on either of the tasks - limits the possibilities for evaluating by-design integrated CS and CR systems. To address this gap, we propose CoSRec, the first dataset for joint Conversational Search and Recommendation (CSR) evaluation. The CoSRec test set includes 20 high-quality conversations, with human-made annotations for the quality of conversations, and manually crafted relevance judgments for products and documents. Additionally, we provide supplementary training data comprising partially annotated dialogues and raw conversations to support diverse learning paradigms. CoSRec is the first resource to model CR and CS tasks in a unified framework, enabling the training and evaluation of systems that must shift between answering queries and making suggestions dynamically.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Personalized product search provides significant benefits to e-commerce platforms by extracting more accurate user preferences from historical behaviors. Previous studies largely focused on the user factors when personalizing the search query, while ignoring the item perspective, which leads to the following two challenges that we summarize in this paper: First, previous approaches relying only on co-occurrence frequency tend to overestimate the conversion rates for popular items and underestimate those for long-tail items, resulting in inaccurate item similarities; Second, user purchasing propensity is highly heterogeneous according to the popularity of the target item: it is less correlated with the user`s historical behavior for a popular item and more correlated for a long-tail item. To address these challenges, in this paper we propose NAM, a Normalization Attention Model, which optimizes ``when to personalize`` by utilizing Inverse Item Frequency (IIF) and employing a gating mechanism, as well as optimizes ``how to personalize`` by normalizing the attention mechanism from a global perspective. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed NAM model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models. Furthermore, we conducted an online A/B test at Fliggy, and obtained a significant improvement of 0.8% over the latest production system in conversion rate.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) models encode text as weighted term vectors, which need to be sparse to leverage inverted index structures during retrieval. SPLADE, the most popular LSR model, uses FLOPS regularization to encourage vector sparsity during training. However, FLOPS regularization does not ensure sparsity among terms---only within a given query or document. Terms with very high Document Frequencies (DFs) substantially increase latency in production retrieval engines, such as Apache Solr, due to their lengthy posting lists. To address the issue of high DFs, we present a new variant of FLOPS regularization: DF-FLOPS. This new regularization technique penalizes the usage of high-DF terms, thereby shortening posting lists and reducing retrieval latency. Unlike other inference-time sparsification methods, such as stopword removal, DF-FLOPS regularization allows for the selective inclusion of high-frequency terms in cases where the terms are truly salient. We find that DF-FLOPS successfully reduces the prevalence of high-DF terms and lowers retrieval latency (around 10x faster) in a production-grade engine while maintaining effectiveness both in-domain (only a 2.2-point drop in MRR@10) and cross-domain (improved performance in 12 out of 13 tasks on which we tested). With retrieval latencies on par with BM25, this work provides an important step towards making LSR practical for deployment in production-grade search engines.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Contrastive Learning (CL) has recently emerged as a powerful technique in recommendation systems, particularly for its capability to harness self-supervised signals from perturbed views to mitigate the data sparsity problem. The process of constructing perturbed views of the user-item bipartite graph and performing CL between perturbed views in a graph convolutional network (GCN) is called graph contrastive learning (GCL). Although existing GCL-based models are effective, the weight assignment method for perturbed views has not been fully explored. A critical problem in existing GCL-based models is the irrational allocation of feature attention. This problem limits the model`s ability to effectively leverage crucial features, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a Weighted Graph Contrastive Learning framework (WeightedGCL). Specifically, WeightedGCL applies a robust perturbation strategy, which perturbs only the view of the final GCN layer. In addition, WeightedGCL incorporates a squeeze and excitation network to dynamically weight the features of the perturbed views. Our WeightedGCL strengthens the model`s focus on crucial features and reduces the impact of less relevant information. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets demonstrate that our WeightedGCL achieves significant accuracy improvements compared to competitive baselines.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Webpage segmentation is a crucial task in web analysis, enablingimprovements in information retrieval, user experience, and automated web understanding. However, existing segmentation datasetsoften lack both comprehensive visual and textual segmentation, aswell as classification systems that capture the functional and qualitative aspects of webpages. In this paper, we introduce a novel webpage segmentation dataset that addresses these gaps by providingboth visual and textual segmentations, alongside two classificationframeworks. The first framework defines a nominal classificationof segments based on their functional roles, such as main content, header, footer, and navigation bar. The second introduces anordinal classification assessing the digital maturity of webpage segments, offering a structured evaluation of their design evolutionand complexity. By integrating both classification schemes intoa single dataset, our approach enables a more holistic analysis ofwebpage structures. Furthermore, given the rapid evolution of webdesign conventions, content structures, and technological trends,our dataset is designed to reflect contemporary webpage characteristics, ensuring its relevance for modern applications in webanalysis and machine learning. Additionally, we provide first results on visual segmentation, demonstrating the effectiveness ofour dataset in practical applications.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Experimental evaluation steers the development of Information Retrieval (IR) systems, and large-scale evaluation campaigns provide the field with a common infrastructure to conduct comparable evaluation exercises. Over the years, tools and platforms have been developed to manage and automate these activities, enhance the reproducibility of conducted experiments and facilitate data sharing. In this context, Evaluation-as-a-Service (EaaS) emerged as an approach to avoid distributing experimental collections, which may contain copyrighted or sensitive data, and instead execute containerised code on that data on remote servers. We propose Kubernetes Infrastructure for Managed Evaluation and Resource Access (KIMERA) as the next step from EaaS into Evaluation-in-the-Cloud (EitC), allowing researchers to directly code and execute their systems through their browsers, requiring only an internet connection. Moreover, recent advancements, such as Large Language Models, or new computing paradigms, such as quantum computers, require external third party services and computational resources. In this respect, KIMERA streamlines and simplifies access to such services on-demand via their APIs. More in detail, KIMERA relies on state-of-the-art containerization and orchestration tools, such as Docker and Kubernetes, to provide a robust, scalable, secure, and fault-tolerant IR evaluation platform. KIMERA monitors and stores all the participants` submissions, accurately keeping track of the resource usage, allowing for evaluating both the efficiency and the effectiveness of the deployed methods. Moreover, all participants can be assigned workspaces sharing the same resources (i.e., CPU and RAM), thus enhancing reproducibility and comparability among systems. Finally, KIMERA has been designed with modularity and extensibility in mind, allowing it to be easily adapted to new use cases and usage scenarios. KIMERA has been developed and adopted in the context of the QuantumCLEF lab, to allow for mixed experiments, comparing approaches running on traditional hardware and on real quantum annealers provided by external companies. KIMERA has also been used as a learning resource to provide Quantum Computing tutorials for IR at major conferences, such as ECIR and SIGIR. The source code of KIMERA is openly available at https://github.com/MjPaxter/KIMERA.',\n",
