## Opening
### Keynote: Managing Knowledge Space
Speaker: *Steffen Staab*

- Data Spaces: Similar to Data Lake $\rightarrow$ to Knowledge Spaces - require semantics, applications + data space
- Knowledge Space: contains multiple KGs/Applications - combine, integrate through semantics
- Context: 
	- DFG Cluster of Excellence – construction industry, novel materials, concepts, ...
		- Knowledge Space: architects $\rightarrow$ engineers $\rightarrow$ ... / past: exchange using paper (or pdf) - works for waterfall process (does not work if anything changes!)
	- Circular Factory for future (CRC)
		- re-use of products by inspection 
		- find defects using CT/... - very individual tasks!
		- Difficult to do in high-paying country (DE, EU)
		- $\approx$ 20 profs with students (a lot of perspectives!)
		- Knowledge managed in ontology + KG $\rightarrow$ store data in an agile manner 
			- allow easy modification 
			- hierarchy of linked ontologies (very interesting for our HEREDITARY use case?); but share data easily!
			- Model statistics using distribution definitions (i.e. add Gaussian variance property to number literal)
	- Supporting people over years - SHACL Constraints as Programming Constraints
		- infer types from SHACL constraints within SPARQL query
		- combining KGs - `CONSTRUCT` query for derived shapes; derived shapes from query
		- Conflicting Shapes / Epistemic (conflicting statements) - resolve Bilattice $\mathcal{F}\mathcal{O}\mathcal{U}\mathcal{R}$
	- Graph Embeddings for Graph Recommendations (TransE - embed in vector spaces by operations in $\ell_2$ space)
		- They extend that concept to boxes/sets/affine spaces - be extended to concepts within KGs 
	- KG foundation models
		- learn/pre-train model for graph embeddings $\rightarrow$ reason on unseen KG based on pattern
		- their work: extend structure by text embedding
		- Oven benchmark: not only Q&A - but unique ID for disambiguation
	- Will LMs "eat" the KGs?
		- Most use cases: Q&A on DBpedia
		- But other use case: finance, factories, construction, **medicine** - require accurate and precise software! - KGs with correct relations are the best there! - combine in RAG/Foundational models
